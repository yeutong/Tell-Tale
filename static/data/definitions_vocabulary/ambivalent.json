{"short": "If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.", "long": "Ambivalent means \"having mixed feelings about something.\" A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning \"both,\" with valentia, \"strength.\" So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things \u2014 but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu."}
