{"short": "If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. \"The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife along the coast.\"", "long": "The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the word decimate its \"drastically reduced\" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean \"to wipe out\" or \"to eliminate.\""}
