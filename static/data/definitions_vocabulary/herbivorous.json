{"short": "A buffalo, a goose, a grasshopper, and a stegosaurus sit down to eat dinner.  This isn\u2019t a joke, it\u2019s an example of herbivorous creatures who exist on a diet of plant life only.", "long": "Herbivorous comes from the Latin word herba, which means \u201cgreen plants,\u201d and that\u2019s what herbivorous animals eat all the time: grass, leaves, and other plants.  Some massive and strong animals actually have peaceful herbivorous eating habits, like gorillas and hippopotamuses.  The opposite of herbivorous is carnivorous, which describes meat-eating beasts like lions, sharks, crocodiles, and your uncle Marvin who eats nothing but steak all day long."}
