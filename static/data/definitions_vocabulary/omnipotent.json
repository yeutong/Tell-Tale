{"short": "If you want to describe someone who can do absolutely anything, reach for the adjective omnipotent.", "long": "Omnipotent comes from the Latin words for total (omni) and power (potent).  Omnipotent is frequently used for deities, but can apply to any exaggerated description of power. If you think that love rules the world, then to you, love is omnipotent. On the other hand, if you think that brute force wins, then maybe your idea of an omnipotent person is a mob boss. The stress is on the second syllable: om-NIP-uh-tent."}
