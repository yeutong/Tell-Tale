{"short": "Funerals are lugubrious. So are rainy days and Mondays. Anything that makes you sad, gloomy, or mournful can be called lugubrious.", "long": "Lugubrious comes from the Latin verb l\u016bg\u0113re, \"to mourn.\" You can also listen to the sound of the word: lugubrious sounds slow, heavy, and sad. Sometimes, just the \"feel\" of a word is enough to clue you in to its meaning, and lugubrious is one of those words. I was feeling great when I got to the concert, but the lugubrious music left me in a terrible mood."}
