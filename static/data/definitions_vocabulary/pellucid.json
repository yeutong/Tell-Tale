{"short": "A sentence that teaches a new vocabulary word should always be pellucid, that is, its style and meaning should be easily understandable so that you can derive the definition from the sentence.", "long": "You may have heard the word lucid, which means clear. Both lucid and pellucid derive from a Latin word that means \"to shine through.\" Pellucid water is clear, a pellucid sky is a particularly intense shade of blue, pellucid prose is writing that's easy to understand, and pellucid singing is clear and light in tone."}
