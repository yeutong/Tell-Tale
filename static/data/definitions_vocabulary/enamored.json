{"short": "The rock star wasn't enamored, or in love, with the idea of performing old-fashioned ballads, until his agent told him there'd be no big paycheck until he started crooning out those romantic tunes.", "long": "Being enamored of something or with someone goes far beyond liking them, and it's even more flowery than love. Enamored means smitten with, or totally infatuated. Someone enamored with another will perhaps even swoon. A man who's in love sends the object of his affection a dozen roses, but if he is enamored with her, he covers her entire front lawn with a blanket of rose petals."}
