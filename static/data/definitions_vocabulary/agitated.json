{"short": "Someone who is agitated is visibly upset. If you have ever walked into a room and instantly been asked, \"What's wrong?\" you probably looked agitated.", "long": "The verb agitate means \"to shake up.\" So someone who is agitated has been shaken up by something \u2014 disturbing news, a careless driver who nearly caused a huge accident, or just a very long, very bad day. Agitated can also describe being activated, or fired up about something. For example, a political cause might be losing steam until an event like a rally gets everyone agitated all over again."}
