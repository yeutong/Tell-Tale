{"short": "When you premeditate, you are planning ahead. While most people associate this word with crime, let's hope you can think of a better reason to premeditate \u0101\u0080\u0094 like buying groceries before a storm.", "long": "When you meditate, you think deeply. The prefix pre- means \u0101\u0080\u009cbefore,\u0101\u0080\u009d so to premeditate means to think about a situation before you\u0101\u0080\u0099ve jumped into it. If you\u0101\u0080\u0099ve ever cooked a meal, you\u0101\u0080\u0099ve premeditated the ingredients you need to get started. In a courtroom you\u0101\u0080\u0099ll hear about \"premeditated murder,\" which means the accused killer planned out his crime and it wasn\u0101\u0080\u0099t a crime of passion. Premeditating can be a good thing, but not when it involves murder."}
