{"short": "Respect is a way of treating or thinking about something or someone. If you respect your teacher, you admire her and treat her well.", "long": "People respect others who are impressive for any reason, such as being in authority \u2014 like a teacher or cop \u2014 or being older \u2014 like a grandparent. You show respect by being polite and kind. For a lot of people, taking your hat off is a show of respect. When people are insulted or treated badly, they feel they haven't been treated with respect. You can respect things as well as people. Saying the Pledge of Allegiance shows respect to your country."}
