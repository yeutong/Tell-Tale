{"short": "Think of the noun nostalgia when you long for the good old days of the past.", "long": "The noun nostalgia was invented by a Swiss doctor in the late 1600s. He put together the Greek nostos \"homecoming\" and algos \"pain, distress\" as a literal translation of the German Heimweh \"homesickness.\" Originally, it was a medical diagnosis for mercenary soldiers. Today, it describes a bittersweet longing for the past. Think of the dreamy way your grandpa tells stories of his childhood \u2014 he's got nostalgia."}
