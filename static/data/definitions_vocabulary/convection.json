{"short": "Convection is the circular motion that happens when warmer air or liquid \u014c\u0106\u00f6 which has faster moving molecules, making it less dense \u014c\u0106\u00f6 rises, while the cooler air or liquid drops down.", "long": "Convection is a major factor in weather. The sun heats the earth\u014c\u0106\u00d6s surface, then, when cooler air comes into contact with it, the air warms and rises, creating an upward current in the atmosphere. That current can result in wind, clouds, or other weather. Convection currents within the earth move layers of magma, and convection in the ocean creates currents. Convection ovens use fans to circulate heat so that whatever you're cooking cooks faster and more evenly."}
