Hopefully that doesn't mean your mother is still dressing you.", "long": "Reminiscent traces back to the Latin for \"remember.\" If a house is reminiscent of your childhood home, it makes you remember your childhood home. Reminiscent can have a good or bad implication. If you tell someone that her paintings are reminiscent of a chimp's finger paintings, obviously that's not so good. But if you tell her that they're reminiscent of Dali, well that might be better."}
