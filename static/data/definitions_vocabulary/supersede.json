{"short": "When something supersedes, it takes the place of something else. The 5th edition of your history textbook supersedes the 4th edition.", "long": "Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin for \"sit on top,\" and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too, as in \"the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older.\" To supersede is generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person."}
