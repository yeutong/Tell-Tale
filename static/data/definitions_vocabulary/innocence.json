{"short": "Innocence means you\u014c\u0106\u00d6ve done nothing wrong.  You\u014c\u0106\u00d6ve broken no laws, committed no sins, and are not guilty of any morally evil act.  Well done.", "long": "In a courtroom, a defendant might announce their innocence, claiming they did not commit whatever crime they\u014c\u0106\u00d6re accused of.  Innocence is very important in many religions, where your moral purity decides what happens to your soul after you die.  The word comes from the Latin innocentia, which means \u014c\u0106\u00a3not harming\u014c\u0106\u00d8 and someone with innocence will not harm themselves or others, at least not on purpose.  Remember that there are no ss in innocence, so spell it with two cs."}
