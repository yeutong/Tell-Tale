{"short": "If only the world were populated entirely with complaisant people! Complaisant means willing to do something to please others, and complaisant people or animals are wonderful to be around.", "long": "Don't confuse complaisant with its near-homonym complacent. Both derive from the Latin complacere \"to please,\" but while complaisant means willing to do something to please another, complacent means smug and self-satisfied, something that you want to avoid when you're on the winning team."}
