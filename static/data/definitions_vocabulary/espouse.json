{"short": "Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouse environmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of taking the car.", "long": "You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean \"to marry,\" but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause. Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that you've chosen to wed yourself to it."}
