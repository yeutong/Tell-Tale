A bandage can stanch bleeding and thick towels can stanch the flow of water across the kitchen floor when you drop a full glass of water.", "long": "The vowel sound in stanch most frequently sounds like on: \"stonch.\" Stanch can also be pronounced to rhyme with branch. Though it's a verb mostly commonly associated with keeping blood from flowing from a wound, the origin is likely the Latin word stagnum, meaning \"pond, pool.\" This word is related to stagnate, describing water that has no movement."}
