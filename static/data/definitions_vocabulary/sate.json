{"short": "Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course meal. Other times it takes just a small salad to sate your appetite, or to satisfy your hunger.", "long": "The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, \u201cto satiate,\u201d and can be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If you have been craving something sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never get enough jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as insatiable, a word used to describe a person or entity whose appetites \u2014 literally or figuratively \u2014 are impossible to satisfy."}
