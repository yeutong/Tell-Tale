{"short": "Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-denial.", "long": "Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning \u201cmonk,\u201d or \u201chermit.\u201d Later that became asketikos, meaning \u201crigorously self-disciplined,\u201d which gives us the Modern English ascetic. Ascetic can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the ability to deprive herself, or an adjective that describes such a people or their lifestyle."}
