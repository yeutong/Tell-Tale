{"short": "When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective imperative.", "long": "Imperative is from Latin imperare, \"to command,\" and its original use was for a verb form expressing a command: \"Do it!\" is an imperative sentence. The word is still used that way, but it's more commonly applied to something so pressing it cannot be put off: \"It's imperative that we hire more workers if we want to complete the job on time.\"  Imperative has more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent."}
