{"short": "Something is antithetical when it is in complete and utter opposition to the character of something. If you\u0101\u0080\u0099re a vegetarian, eating giant T-bone steaks is antithetical to your beliefs.", "long": "You\u0101\u0080\u0099ll find that antithetical is a useful word when you\u0101\u0080\u0099re trying to express an extreme contrast. If someone is trying to convince you to do something you don\u0101\u0080\u0099t believe in, or to allow an organization you\u0101\u0080\u0099re involved with to adopt measures you are strongly against, you can use antithetical. You go out to vote because sitting out of the voting process is antithetical to what you believe in.  If you find that your club wants to adopt exclusive measures when it is supposed to be open, you'll tell them that that's antithetical to the club's purpose."}
