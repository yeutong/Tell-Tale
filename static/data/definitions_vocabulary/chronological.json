{"short": "If you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re making a list of all your teachers in the order you had them, from kindergarten right up to the present, you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re listing them in chronological order. Chronological is the order in which things actually happened.", "long": "Chronological doesn\u014c\u0106\u00d6t allow for time traveling or flashbacks. If you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re making a documentary of events leading up to World War II and you start in the early 1900s and end at the outbreak of the war, in 1939, that\u014c\u0106\u00d6s chronological.  Reverse chronological order means giving the most recent event first, and going backwards from there. Chronological includes the useful Greek root khronos, \"time.\""}
