{"short": "The noun comity means a state of civility or courtesy between people, organizations, and nations. It's a hoped-for mutual respect and friendliness, although too infrequently the case in politics and business.", "long": "Comity is one of those rare words that has retained its original meaning through the ages. The Latin adjective c\u014dmis, \"courteous, friendly,\" developed into the noun c\u014dmit\u0101tem, meaning \"courtesy or friendliness\" and ultimately into English comity in the 16th century. The phrase \"comity of nations,\" coined in 1862, refers to the mutual respect for each other's laws and institutions that encourages a friendly back-and-forth between nations."}
