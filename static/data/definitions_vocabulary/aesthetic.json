{"short": "The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.", "long": "Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning \"perception,\" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has \"aesthetic value,\" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an \"aesthetic painting.\""}
