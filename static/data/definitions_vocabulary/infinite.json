{"short": "Infinite describes things that are endless, like the universe, or your uncle's corny jokes.", "long": "Finite means \"relating to something with an end,\" and when you add the prefix in-, meaning \"not,\" you get infinite: having to do with something that never, ever ends. If someone has read every single book about pyramids, you might say he has an infinite knowledge of ancient Egyptian culture, even though that's an exaggeration. Surely he'll stop talking about them at some point...right?"}
