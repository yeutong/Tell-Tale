{"short": "To propel is to push or drive forward, like a sheep dog nipping at the heels of his flock to keep them moving.", "long": "When you hear the verb propel,  imagine the propeller on an airplane \u2014 that spinning thing on the front that pulls the plane forward. Or maybe think of the old proverb that goes, \u201cOur passions are the winds that propel our vessel. Our reason is the pilot that steers her. Without winds the vessel would not move and without a pilot she would be lost.\u201d"}
