{"short": "If you eschew something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then most likely you eschew the suburbs.", "long": "Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn\u2019t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle\u2013\u2013it's stronger than that. You eschew things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn\u2019t like it, but because he\u2019s afraid of what it will do to his waistline."}
