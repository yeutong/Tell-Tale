{"short": "A pesticide is a bug-killing poison. You may have to resort to using a pesticide to battle the ants that have invaded your kitchen, even if you hate killing any creature.", "long": "Pesticides are most often used to ward off insects or small animals living uninvited in a person's house, or in a garden or on a farm, when they are nibbling on plants or flowers. The Latin suffix cide means \"killer,\" and in pesticide, it's combined with the English word pest, which means just what it sounds like \u2014 a troublesome annoyance."}
