When you adopt something, you consciously select it and accept it as your own.", "long": "The word adopt has many different shades of meaning, but most relate to the notion of taking something on and treating it as if it\u2019s your own. You\u2019re probably familiar with what happens if you adopt a child: you take on parental responsibilities and accept the child as if it\u2019s your own.
