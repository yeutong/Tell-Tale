If it's 3 pm and you still have to study for three exams and write an essay before midnight, it\u2019s implausible that you\u2019ll also have time to watch a movie.", "long": "The adjective implausible breaks down into im, meaning \u201cnot,\u201d and plausible, meaning \"likely.\" So it simply means \"not likely.\" Implausible ideas or stories usually get high marks for creativity, but they're just too crazy to be believable. But as philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes noted, \u201cOne cannot conceive anything so strange and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher or another.\u201d"}
