{"short": "The verb stymie means to obstruct or hinder. Constantly texting with your friends will stymie your effort to finish your homework.", "long": "Stymie was first used on the golf course in Scotland, where it referred to an opponent's ball blocking your own ball\u2019s path to the cup. From there a verb sense developed, until finally stymie came to mean blocking with any obstacle, not just a golf ball."}
