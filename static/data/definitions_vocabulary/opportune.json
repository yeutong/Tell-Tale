{"short": "Use the adjective opportune to describe especially good timing. A snowstorm is an opportune time to make extra money shoveling your neighbor's driveway.", "long": "You can see the word opportunity in opportune. Both words come from the Latin word opportunus, meaning \"favorable,\" which itself is derived from a phrase that describes wind blowing toward a port. Just as the wind helps speed ships toward shore, something that is opportune offers favorable circumstances for accomplishing something or doing something."}
