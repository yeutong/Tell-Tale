{"short": "Vegetables? Forget it. If you're into eating meat, meat and more meat, then you're carnivorous.", "long": "Not surprisingly, the adjective carnivorous can be traced back to the Latin word for \"flesh.\" Carnivorous eaters get their fill of other animals, so they've also got a reputation for being savage or predatory. So anyone who stalks around like a lion on the hunt could also be described as carnivorous, even if they're a card-carrying vegetarian."}
