{"short": "Circumlocution is a long, complicated word which means a long, complicated way of expressing something. To cut to the chase, circumlocution means to beat around the bush.", "long": "Circumlocution comes from the Latin words circum, \"circle,\" and loqui, \"to speak.\" So circumlocution is speaking in circles, going round and round in a wordy way without ever getting to the heart of the matter. It's an evasive style of argument, best employed when you really don't want to say what's on your mind."}
