{"short": "Ever see someone talking while alone on a stage? That's what you call a soliloquy \u0101\u0080\u0094 a speech made by a character in a drama as if that character is voicing their own private thoughts. Shakespeare's plays are full of soliloquies.", "long": "The noun soliloquy comes from the Latin roots solus (\"alone\") plus loqui (\"speak\") \u0101\u0080\u0094 so the word literally means \"an act of speaking to oneself.\" A soliloquy is a dramatic speech that reveals a character's inner thoughts and reflections. Some of the most famous lines in drama are taken from soliloquies. Hamlet's famous \"To be or not to be\" speech is a soliloquy, for example."}
