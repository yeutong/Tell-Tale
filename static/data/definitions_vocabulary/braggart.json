{"short": "If you know someone who is a real show off and is always bragging about how great they are, then you might call this boaster a braggart.", "long": "Braggart is a pejorative word, which means it is used as an insult, so you shouldn\u2019t call your boss or your teacher a braggart \u2014 unless you\u2019re looking for trouble. Braggart is similar to other pejoratives like blowhard or bigmouth. Braggarts are characterized by talking loudly (usually in praise of themselves, their possessions, or their accomplishments) and are quick to assert their superiority over others."}
