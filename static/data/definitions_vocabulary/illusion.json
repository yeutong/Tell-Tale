{"short": "An illusion is something that isn't real. It may look real, but it's actually fake \u2014 just a crafty construction or fantasy. Like the old rabbit-out-of-the-hat trick practiced by magicians around the globe.", "long": "An illusion is an act of deception. Some optical illusions are pretty cool to watch, but an illusion can also point to an erroneous belief or false perception of reality, which is where you start getting into hallucination territory \u2014 seeing things that aren't there. You can give the illusion that you\u2019re fascinated by your professor\u2019s lecture by chewing on your pencil, furrowing your brow, and making sure to nod enthusiastically every so often."}
