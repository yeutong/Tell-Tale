{"short": "Integrity is a personal quality of fairness that we all aspire to \u2014 unless you're a dishonest, immoral scoundrel, of course.", "long": "Having integrity means doing the right thing in a reliable way. It's a personality trait that we admire, since it means a person has a moral compass that doesn't waver. It literally means having \"wholeness\" of character, just as an integer is a \"whole number\" with no fractions. Physical objects can display integrity, too \u2014 if you're going over a rickety old bridge that sways in the wind, you might question its structural integrity."}
