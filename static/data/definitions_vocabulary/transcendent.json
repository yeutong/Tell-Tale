{"short": "Transcendent describes something so excellent that it's beyond the range of human understanding.", "long": "Transcendent shares the prefix trans, meaning \"across,\" with many familiar words such as transport (\"carry across\"), transcontinental (\r\nacross a continent\"), and transparent (\"allowing light to shine across\"). Transcendental meditation carries people across to a higher consciousness. So something transcendent goes across boring reality into super awesomeness in a world all its own. It moves you. Angels are transcendent, and even your favorite novel can be transcendent."}
