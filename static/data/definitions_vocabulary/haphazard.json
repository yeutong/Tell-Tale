{"short": "Anything haphazard is random, disorganized, slipshod, or hit-or-miss. A tent erected haphazardly might look more like a big nylon bag of dirty laundry than a place to sleep.", "long": "Ever heard the expression \"I'll hazard a guess?\" In it, the word hazard means \"chance,\" as in \"take a chance.\"  Think of the hap in haphazard as short for \"happen.\" Combine hap- and -hazard and you get something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you approach a math problem with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get it wrong."}
