{"short": "An island is a piece of land that is surrounded on all sides by water. Some islands are so small that a beach chair and umbrella barely fit on them and some are big enough to contain a whole nation.", "long": "To get to an island you must take a boat, bridge or airplane \u2014 be a strong swimmer. If you can get there by land it\u2019s not an island, though it may be a peninsula, like Florida. There are many famous islands, like Manhattan and the islands of Hawaii. Things that are free-standing can also be called islands, like the island made of cabinets and a counter that is found in some kitchens \u2014 it's not connected to anything else."}
