If you're anxious to get outside and enjoy the sun, even the best lecture will seem tedious.", "long": "Tedious is the adjective from tedium, which is both Latin and English for boredom. You ordinarily wouldn't use tedious for people, just things; you might say \"His speeches are tedious,\" but usually not \"He is tedious.\" Something that is tedious could also be called tiresome.
