{"short": "If something turns off course or is diverted, it deviates from the expected or the norm. Deviating from explicit recipe directions is never a good idea, unless you want inedible food or a kitchen fire.", "long": "The verb deviate can refer to divergence from a predicted path or road (\"the airplane's route deviated from the flight plan\"), but it can also refer to a divergence from normal behavior or expectations. When women demanded the right to vote, their behavior was considered shocking and deviated from the expectations of the time."}
