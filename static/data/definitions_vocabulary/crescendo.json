{"short": "In a crescendo, the music is getting louder. There's often a crescendo in a large group of talking people, too.", "long": "This word comes from classical music, where it's very important how loudly the instruments play. If a tuba is crescendoing at the wrong time, then a quiet piano part might not be heard at all. The crescendo is important in all kinds of music, because volume \u2014 how loud something is \u2014 is one of the main features of music. If you are whispering and gradually raise your voice and then end up shouting, that's a crescendo as well."}
