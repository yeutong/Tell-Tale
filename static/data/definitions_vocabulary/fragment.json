{"short": "A fragment is a small piece that\u2019s come off a larger whole, and to fragment is to break. If your teacher writes \"frag\" on your paper, you've got an incomplete sentence.", "long": "Fragment, meaning \"a tiny, brittle shard,\" first appeared as a noun and later as a verb. That afternoon you hacked away at the fireplace in your parents\u2019 living room in search of secret treasure as a child? Those dusty chunks of brick you scattered all over their shag carpet were fragments of a once-intact wall, and a happier time before you were grounded. Not only did you cause physical damage that day, but you also fragmented their trust in you."}
