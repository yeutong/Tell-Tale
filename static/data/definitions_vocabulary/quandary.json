{"short": "How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a quandary: a tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.", "long": "If you\u2019re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem unpleasant, you\u2019re probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more common quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can\u2019t decide which one to attend. Some synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight, and pickle \u2014 and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself."}
