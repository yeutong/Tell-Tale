{"short": "A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a clear distinction between two things.", "long": "A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas \u2014 like war and peace, or love and hate \u2014 you have a dichotomy. You often hear about a \"false dichotomy,\" which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an \"either/or\" scenario. For example, the statement \"All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting\" creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars that don't fit into either category."}
