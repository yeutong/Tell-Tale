{"short": "Every school, museum, and struggling artist is in search for a generous benefactor, or someone to provide the financial means to keep everything running smoothly.", "long": "The Latin roots of benefactor are bene, which means \"well,\" and facere, which means \"to do\" \u2014 literally, \"to do well.\"  A benefactor does well by supporting (usually financially) a person or a good cause. In the old days, a struggling artist or actor might have been supported by a wealthy benefactor. Now, many struggling artists and actors have to rely on waiting tables and other odd jobs instead."}
