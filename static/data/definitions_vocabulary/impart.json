{"short": "Let me impart a little bit of knowledge to you about the word impart. It means to pass on, transmit, or bestow. If you share this with your study partner, you are imparting your new wisdom.", "long": "Studying imparts confidence as well as information, long life imparts wisdom, and anise seed imparts the flavor of licorice. Your mother can impart the importance of dressing neatly each and every day. Though it shares a root with the word part, impart doesn't mean to split into pieces, but rather to divide or share with another. Let me impart this message to you \u2014 always do your part!"}
