{"short": "An election is a vote to decide who will hold a political office. Every four years, there is the election of a new U.S. President.", "long": "If you have been following politics for long, you'll hear about plenty of elections: votes held every few years for political office. Mayors, governors, judges, and the President are all put in office by elections. You can also speak of the election of a winner: for example, \"Her election was close.\" An election can also mean any kind of choice, such as \"his election to move to Vermont.\" All the meanings of this word have to do with exercising choice."}
