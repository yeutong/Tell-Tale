{"short": "If you're sanguine about a situation, that means you're optimistic that everything's going to work out fine.", "long": "Sanguine is from Latin sanguis \"blood\" and originally meant \"bloody\" \u2014 in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that \"bodily humors\" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no longer believe in humors, sanguine has settled down as a fancy way to say someone is cheerfully confident.  Experts are frequently described as feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation \u2014 or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket."}
