{"short": "Your opinion that most comedies are terrible and that you'd rather watch any other kind of movie could be described as your sentiment, or your attitude, about films.", "long": "Sentiment means a view or opinion, but it can also mean an emotion. Maybe you prefer tragic movies because you enjoy the sentiment of sadness. This meaning of sentiment is taken to an extreme in yet another version of the word, meaning something like \"overdone, exaggerated feelings, especially of sadness or nostalgia.\" An overly soppy tragedy is a good example of this kind of sentiment; it's the kind of film that might make you cringe instead of cry."}
