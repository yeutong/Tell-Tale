{"short": "Reserved for the harmlessly stupid and truly meaningless, vacuous is a smart-sounding way to describe something dumb. Celebrity gossip and reality TV are usually pretty vacuous, even if they're fun.", "long": "If someone smiles at you in a way that seems fake or empty, you could describe the smile as vacuous.  An example of a vacuous comment would be a politician promising to make things better without explaining how.  If something is vacuous, it's like a vacuum \u2014 hollow, empty, devoid of substance."}
