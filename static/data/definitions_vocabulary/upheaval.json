{"short": "Upheaval means a violent or sudden change. You might talk about an upheaval in government following an election where many incumbents are replaced.", "long": "Upheaval is a geological term for the upward displacement of the earth's crust that has stretched to include a change in power or ideas. If you suddenly found out your favorite teacher was running a pyramid scheme and had escaped to a Caribbean island, you might experience an upheaval in your attitude toward teachers in general."}
