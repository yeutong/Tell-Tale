{"short": "If you want to be rude, you'll obtrude, or thrust yourself to the front of a line without waiting.", "long": "Who asked you? If the answer is no one, chances are you've decided to obtrude or shove your ideas and opinions into everyone's face. Obtrude has its origins in the Latin ob meaning \"toward\" and trudere meaning \"to thrust.\" An intruder climbing through your kitchen window is someone who chooses to obtrude, or forcefully enter your home."}
