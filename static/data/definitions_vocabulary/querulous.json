{"short": "Querulous means \u201chaving a tendency to complain\u201d or, more directly put, \u201cwhiny.\u201d Sure, no one can be happy all the time, but that\u2019s no excuse for being querulous.", "long": "Querulous may remind you of the word query, which means \u201cquestion.\u201d However, the two words are not closely related. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to make a query; just don\u2019t be querulous if you don\u2019t like the answer you get. Querulous does share its origins with the word quarrel, which means \u201cargument\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s likely to happen if you complain too much."}
