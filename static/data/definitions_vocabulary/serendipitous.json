{"short": "Serendipitous is an adjective that describes accidentally being in the right place at the right time, like bumping into a good friend in some unusual location, or finding a hundred dollar bill on the ground.", "long": "The root of serendipitous comes from the fairy tale \"The Three Princes of Serendip,\" in which three princes make one lucky and surprising discovery after another.  A serendipitous moment happens by accident, usually when you\u2019re doing something completely unrelated, like digging a hole in your yard to bury your hamster and finding a treasure chest of jewels.  That\u2019s a sad but serendipitous funeral."}
