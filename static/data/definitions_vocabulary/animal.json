{"short": "An animal is a particular kind of living organism, one that can move voluntarily and can find and digest food. Your favorite animal might be the naked mole rat, but probably not.", "long": "Although a human is biologically an animal, the word often distinguishes humans from other kinds of animals, like when scientists talk about diseases passing from animals to people. Sometimes the word animal means a cruel, violent, or uncivilized person: \"He just destroyed my house at the party last night \u2014 what an animal!\" The Latin word for \"soul,\" anima, led to animale, or \"living being, a being that breathes.\" Before 1500, the word \"beast\" was much more commonly used than animal."}
