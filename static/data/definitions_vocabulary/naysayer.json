{"short": "A naysayer is a person who always says \"No.\" Naysayers are negative and cynical \u014c\u0106\u00f6 they aren't much fun to be around.", "long": "If you respond to every invitation with, \"No thanks \u014c\u0106\u00f6 I wouldn't have fun anyway,\" and answer questions about how your day was with a list of complaints, you're a naysayer. It's your negative, pessimistic attitude that makes you a naysayer. In the 1600s a nay-say was a \"refusal,\" from the now less common use of nay to mean \"no.\""}
