{"short": "When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer  is to make a well informed guess \u2014 if you see your mom\u2019s bag on the table, you might infer that she\u2019s home.", "long": "When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually said. It\u2019s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions \u2014 guesses based on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think \"educated guess.\""}
