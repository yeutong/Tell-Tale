{"short": "Censorship is inimical to freedom. So, most teenagers would argue, are curfews. To be inimical is to be harmful, antagonistic, or opposed to something.", "long": "Inimical comes from the Latin word inimicus, meaning \"enemy.\" It suggests acting like someone's enemy \u2014 being adverse, damaging, or downright hostile. It can refer to anything from emotions and actions to public policy. The U.S. government might declare that another nation's actions are inimical to national security \u2014 and your mom might declare that eating a dozen doughnuts every morning is inimical to your health. Be careful not to mix up inimical with inimitable, which means too good to be copied."}
