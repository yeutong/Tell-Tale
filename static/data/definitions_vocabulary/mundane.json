{"short": "An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called mundane: \"Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his mundane alter ego, Clark Kent.\"", "long": "Mundane, from the Latin word mundus, \"world,\" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a Newsweek writer opined, \"In reality bizarro-world, the mundane is presented as the spectacular\" \u2014 in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment."}
