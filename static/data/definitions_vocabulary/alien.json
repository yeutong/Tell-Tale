{"short": "Something that's alien is different or foreign. In science fiction, space aliens come from other planets.", "long": "When we talk about aliens, or things that are alien, we're talking about things and people that are different and strange to us \u2014 like an alien from outer space. Some people refer to undocumented immigrants as \"aliens,\" but nowadays, the term is often considered dehumanizing. Besides people, experiences can be alien. If you've never owned a cat, then having a cat is alien to you. You can also alienate people by making them feel weird, disconnected, and alone \u2014 like an alien."}
