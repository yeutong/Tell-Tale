{"short": "Medicine is the field (and body of knowledge) that teaches doctors how to help people. Doctors also give medicine to patients.", "long": "Cough syrup, antibiotics, and pills are all forms of medicine. When someone gives you medicine, they are medicating you. People who study medicine become doctors and nurses. Without the field of medicine \u2014 which expands all the time \u2014 there would be so much more sickness and death. Medicine is devoted to finding out everything about health, illness, and the human body."}
