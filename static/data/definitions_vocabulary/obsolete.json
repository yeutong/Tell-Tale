{"short": "Use the adjective obsolete for something that is out of date. As the Rolling Stones song \"Out of Time\" goes, \"You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old-fashioned baby.\"", "long": "Obsolete is from the Latin obsolescere \"to fall into disuse,\" and it is a very handy adjective for anything that is no longer used, from words to factories to computer software to ways of thinking. Something that is obsolete has usually been displaced by a newer, shinier innovation. Compact discs made records and cassettes obsolete, and then downloadable digital music files made compact discs obsolete."}
