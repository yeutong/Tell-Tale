{"short": "A tonic is something, sometimes a medicine, that makes you feel better or restores you to health. Before doctors prescribed drugs, crooked salesmen sold all sorts of dubious tonics.", "long": "Tonic was used to describe all sorts of concoctions that were supposed to make you feel better or livelier. Some helped and some didn\u2019t. Coca Cola was originally marketed as a tonic \u2014 back when it is said to have contained cocaine as well as loads of caffeine. These days we might describe a weekend at the beach or a brisk walk as a tonic, meaning it will refresh you. Others might flee to a gin and tonic \u2014 an alcoholic drink."}
