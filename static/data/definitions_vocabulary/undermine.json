{"short": "To undermine literally means to dig a hole underneath something, making it likely to collapse. But we more often use the word to describe sabotage or the act of weakening someone else's efforts.", "long": "Originally spelled with a \u2018y\u2019 instead of an \u2018i\u2019, undermine has Germanic roots and means \"to weaken, hinder, or impair.\" Accidentally undermine the foundation of a house by digging a tunnel to China beneath it and you might be forgiven. Undermine your teacher\u2019s authority by speaking out of turn and throwing spitballs and odds are you\u2019ll get in trouble."}
