{"short": "A catastrophe is a disaster. If a wedding reception is disrupted by a fistfight between the bride and her new mother-in-law, you could call the occasion a catastrophe.", "long": "Catastrophe comes from a Greek word meaning \"overturn.\" It originally referred to the disastrous finish of a drama, usually a tragedy. The definition was extended to mean \"any sudden disaster\" in the 1700s. Nowadays, catastrophe can be used to refer to very tragic events as well as more minor ones. A hurricane destroying hundreds of homes is certainly a catastrophe; baking a birthday cake without following a recipe might also result in catastrophe, if you don't know anything about cooking."}
