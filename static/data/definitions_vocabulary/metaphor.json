{"short": "If you brag that \"the world's your oyster,\" you're using a metaphor from Shakespeare, who knew a thing or two about figures of speech.", "long": "Good writers know their way around a metaphor, where you make an analogy between two things to show how one resembles the other in some way. When a character from Shakespeare calls the world his oyster, that's his  boastful way of saying that all the riches of the world are his for the taking, like plucking a pearl from an oyster shell. Shakespeare also wrote, \"All the world's a stage.\" Oyster? Stage? Come on, Will, get your metaphors straight!"}
