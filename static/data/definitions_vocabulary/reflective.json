{"short": "Reflective is an adjective that can describe a person who thinks things through, or a surface that reflects light or sound, like the reflective lettering on a stop sign.", "long": "To reflect is to bounce back an image, light, or sound. A reflective surface is one that can bounce back light \u2014 like the reflective sun shade that you put over the windshield of your car. It bounces the sun's rays away, helping the interior cool. A reflective person is a little different \u2014 he or she might have great insight due to taking the time to time carefully about things."}
