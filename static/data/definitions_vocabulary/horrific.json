{"short": "Something horrific causes horror. It\u2019s disastrous and makes you shudder with fear. Yikes!", "long": "If something horrific, like a deadly car crash, makes your hair stand up, you\u2019re onto something. Horrific comes from the Latin word horrificus \u2014 which, if you trace it back, literally means \u201cmaking the hair stand on end.\u201d Anything horrific fills you with horror and makes you bristle. If you lose your hat, that\u2019s a bummer. A serial killer\u2019s rampage? That's horrific. Save horrific for things that are so scary your hair stands up, or feels like it is."}
