{"short": "If your little brother quietly obeys your instructions and waits for you at the food court while you and your friends wander around the mall, he's probably a tractable child, meaning he's obedient, flexible, and responds well to directions.", "long": "Note the similarity between tractable and tractor.  Both come from the Latin word tractare, which originally meant \"to drag about.\"  You can think of a tractable person as someone who can be dragged about easily, like a plow being dragged by a tractor."}
