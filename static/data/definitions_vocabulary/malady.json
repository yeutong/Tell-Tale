{"short": "A malady is an illness, like a malady that keeps you home, sick in bed for days, or something that causes you to have trouble or to suffer, like jet lag \u2014 a malady that affects travelers.", "long": "Malady, pronounced \"MAL-uh-dee,\" comes from the Latin words male, meaning \"bad or ill\" and habitus for \"have, hold.\" When you have a malady, it is like something bad is holding you, such as an illness \u2014 the common cold: a malady of winter. Some bad habits cause maladies, such as never having any money \u2014 the malady of people who spend freely, not thinking of the future."}
