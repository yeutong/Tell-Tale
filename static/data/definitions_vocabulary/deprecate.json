{"short": "To deprecate is to show disapproval or to make someone feel unimportant by speaking to them disrespectfully, like seniors who deprecate younger students just for fun.", "long": "To deprecate is to diminish, or to oppose, like when someone deprecates your dream of climbing Mt. Everest by calling it \"a little walk up a hill.\" Some people deprecate themselves, which is called being self-deprecating. People who are self-deprecating downplay their abilities because they are humble \u2014 or want to appear that way. So if you do climb Everest and you are self-deprecating, you'll say it wasn't such a big deal, even if it was the proudest moment of your life."}
