{"short": "Elude means \"evade or escape,\" like the way you might elude the other kids during a game of hide-and-seek. This word can also mean \"to be hard to understand.\" No matter how hard you try, the finer points of quantum physics might elude you.", "long": "Elude has a slippery feeling to it. You elude the police, math can elude you \u2014 and that yak you went to see on safari but never got a glimpse of, you might say that he has eluded you as well. Delude means \"to deceive,\" and there are times when someone can both delude and elude you \u2014 like when the conman took your money and then escaped out the back door."}
