{"short": "To discomfit someone is to make them feel uncomfortable or upset. An easy way to discomfit another person is to use the age-old, childish trick of ignoring them. (Of course, we\u014c\u0106\u00d6re sure you would never do that, right? Right?)", "long": "If you make someone blush, sweat, and generally want to disappear, you\u014c\u0106\u00d6ve discomfited her. Centuries ago, discomfit was used to mean \u014c\u0106\u00a3destroy completely in battle\u014c\u0106\u00d8 \u014c\u0106\u00f6 an experience that surely left the defeated armies feeling something more than mere discomfort. Some scholars have suggested that the contemporary meaning of discomfit arose due to confusion with the word discomfort. Don\u014c\u0106\u00d6t be discomfited by choosing the wrong word; use this word to mean \u014c\u0106\u00a3embarrass.\u014c\u0106\u00d8"}
