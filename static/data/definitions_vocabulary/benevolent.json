{"short": "Choose the adjective benevolent for someone who does good deeds or shows goodwill. If your teacher collects homework with a benevolent smile, she's hoping that you've done a good job.", "long": "Benevolent comes from the Latin bene, \"well,\" and volent, from a verb meaning \"to wish.\"  A benevolent society is a charity group organized to serve a community through programs, sponsorships, and donations. The expression \"benevolent dictatorship\" may seem like an oxymoron, but it is a political term for an authoritative government that (supposedly) works for the good of the people under its rule."}
