{"short": "An idiom is a form of expression that is particular to a certain person or group of people. If your friend always says, \"squirrelly nuteriffic!\" when she means something is great, she's using her own idiom.", "long": "Idiom comes from the Greek idios, which means personal. Idiom originally meant \"speech peculiar or proper to a people or country.\" These days we use idiom for a specialized vocabulary or an expression that isn't obvious, like kick the bucket which means \"die.\" If you're studying a foreign language, idioms are the hardest phrases to translate."}
