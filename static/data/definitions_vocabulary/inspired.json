{"short": "Inspired is an adjective that describes something of excellent quality. If your singing in a choral concert is particularly inspired, people can hear your voice hitting all the right notes beautifully.", "long": "If something is so extraordinary that it's worthy of being described as inspired, you might think that the gods had something to do with its creation. In fact, inspired originally meant \"directly inspired by God or gods.\" It comes from the Latin in-\"in\" and spirare \"to breathe.\" Maybe such supernatural power did breathe life into something truly excellent. Or maybe the humans just worked very hard and had a great idea."}
