{"short": "Replete means full, often in a satisfying way. \"The library was replete with bound first editions, and Lucy, a bookworm, was happier there than any place else.\"", "long": "Replete shares a root with the word plenty. When you have plenty of cookies and cake, you can say your table is replete with goodies. Another cousin of replete is replenish. When your cabinets are bare, you go to the store to replenish them. When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is replete with essentials."}
