When you stand on your desk and tell the class that your partner is cheating, you denounce him or her.", "long": "The prefix de- means \"down,\" as in destroy or demolish (tear down). Add that to the Latin root nuntiare, meaning \"announce,\" and de- plus announce equals denounce. It's a word that shows up in the headlines often, as a country might denounce a corrupt election. Politicians love to denounce the shady behavior or their opponents. Denounce can also mean the official end of something, like a treaty."}
