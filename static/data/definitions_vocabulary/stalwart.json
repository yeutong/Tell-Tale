{"short": "To be stalwart is to be courageous and dependable, like a stalwart knight who defends a kingdom from a ferocious dragon.", "long": "Stalwart can describe someone who's able to keep on going even when things get hard, like a marathon runner who doesn't slow down even after spraining an ankle, or a supporter of a political cause that everyone else has long declared over. In U.S. history, the word stalwart was used in 1877 to describe Republicans who remained unwilling to trust the South, even though the Civil War was long over by that time."}
