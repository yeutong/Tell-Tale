{"short": "Imbibe is a fancy word for \"drink.\"  If you need to imbibe ten cups of coffee just to get out of the house, you might have a caffeine problem.", "long": "Although the verb imbibe means to take in liquids of any sort, if you don't specify the liquid, people are likely to infer you mean an alcoholic beverage.  You can also use it figuratively.  If you have imbibed every detail about every battle of the U.S. Civil War, you must find the subject interesting."}
