{"short": "A repercussion is something that happens because of another action. You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your apartment might be the repercussion.", "long": "Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion \u2014 what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum) getting hit. With repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that original strike over and over as it reverberates through the air."}
