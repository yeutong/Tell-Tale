{"short": "Equitable distribution means everyone gets their fair share of something.If you work on a group project in class, you want an equitable share of the credit.", "long": "When you look at equitable, you might think you see the word, equal, but it doesn't mean fair in the sense of exactly the same. If you worked ten hours at a lemonade stand and your friend worked five, you'd want an equitable share of the profits rather than an equal share. Equitable would take into account the amount of work you did, equal would not."}
