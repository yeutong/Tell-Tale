{"short": "If you elucidate something, you explain it very clearly. If you don't understand fractions, a visit to the pie shop may elucidate the subject for you.", "long": "Elucidate, meaning \"to make clear,\" is from the Late Latin elucidare, from the Latin prefix e-, \"thoroughly,\" and lucidus, \"clear, bright.\"  See the word lucid in elucidate? That's an adjective which describes someone who thinks clearly or something that is clear enough to understand."}
