{"short": "If you can describe something as possible but not yet actual, choose the adjective potential. Companies try to reach potential customers through advertising.", "long": "Potential, from the Latin potentia \"power,\" sounds more complicated than it is. It describes something or someone that has the power to become something. A potential success is not yet a success but could be if circumstances are right. When a situation has the potential for disaster, it could turn bad easily. You have potential if you have a natural but undeveloped ability to do something and a building with potential will be really nice once it's fixed up."}
