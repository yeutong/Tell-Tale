{"short": "See incinerate and think: \"burn, baby, burn!\" Whether it\u0101\u0080\u0099s an old love letter that makes you sad or a terrible picture of yourself, it might be better just to incinerate it, meaning, you burn it.", "long": "When you burn something beyond recognition, you incinerate it, as its Latin origins in incinerare, or \"into ashes\" shows. Once you incinerate something, that\u0101\u0080\u0099s pretty much all that\u0101\u0080\u0099s left: ashes. The word has a formal feel and is often used to refer to the removal of waste material \u0101\u0080\u0094 your city might incinerate garbage, for example \u0101\u0080\u0094 but you can use it any time you need to reduce something to ashes."}
