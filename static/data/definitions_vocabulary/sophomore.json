{"short": "A sophomore is in their second year, either in high school or college.  Once you became a sophomore, thinking you now knew everything, you pitied the freshmen for their confusion over how to write college papers.", "long": "Sophomore comes from the word sophism which means \"a bad argument that's clever but false,\" and that's sometimes how sophomores in college act. They're not bright-eyed newcomers anymore, and think they know a lot, but really they've much to learn. We also use the word for other seconds: a band's second album is usually called their sophomore album."}
