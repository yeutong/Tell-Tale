{"short": "Amorphous means without a clearly defined form, like the moon's amorphous reflection in a lake. Figuratively, something amorphous lacks focus, be it a work of art, a political movement, or even someone's life plans.", "long": "The Greek roots of this word are clear:  morph\u0113 means \"form,\" and a- means \"lacking or without.\" When creative works or ideas are described as amorphous, it means they suffer from a lack of organization. An amorphous object lacks a well-defined outline or structure, like amorphous jellyfish drifting on the surface of the ocean.  And scientifically, this adjective simply describes something without a crystalline form, like an amorphous metal or amorphous ice."}
