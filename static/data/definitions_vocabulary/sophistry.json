{"short": "Sophistry is tricking someone by making a seemingly clever argument, like a philosopher who argues that up is down and somehow convinces you. If you accuse someone of sophistry, you mean they\u014c\u0106\u00d6ll lie to make a point.", "long": "The word sophistry has roots in ancient Greece. The Sophists were teachers who were celebrated in their time but were later thought to be more like con artists who would say anything to win an argument. Sophistry is like spin \u014c\u0106\u00f6 it means twisting the truth to bend to one\u014c\u0106\u00d6s needs. Politician might accuse people who disagree with them of using sophistry."}
