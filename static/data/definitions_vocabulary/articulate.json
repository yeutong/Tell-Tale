{"short": "To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.", "long": "Reach for articulate when you need an adjective meaning \"well-spoken\" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning \"to speak or express yourself clearly.\" The key to understanding articulate's many uses is to think of the related noun article: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts."}
