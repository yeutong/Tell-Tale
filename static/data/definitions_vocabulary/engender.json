{"short": "Engender is a fancy way of saying \"to make happen,\" like when you engender the spirit of teamwork and cooperation by encouraging others and doing your share of the group's work.", "long": "The verb engender has nothing to do with being male or female, though originally, it did mean \"beget, procreate.\" Today, engender means \"to produce or bring about.\" When students come to class prepared, meaning they've read their assignment, this engenders better class discussions, just as mutual trust and the desire to help each other engenders a meaningful friendship."}
