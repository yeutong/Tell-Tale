{"short": "It was pretty courageous of the automaker Plymouth to name a car the \"Valiant\" in the 1960s and 70s because that term usually refers to a hero or describes a really determined, or valiant, effort that doesn't end well.", "long": "Synonyms for valiant include \"heroic\" and \"courageous,\" so it isn\u2019t surprising that those who serve in the military often are called valiant. The 14th-century French origins of the word are \"bold\" or \"of worth,\" which makes the adjective valiant a good one for describing ordinary people who put all they have into something, making their efforts valiant, even if they fail. The Plymouth Valiant, by the way, was considered a strong and successful car, though valiant usually refers to people."}
