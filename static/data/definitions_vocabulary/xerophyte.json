{"short": "A xerophyte is a plant that can survive with very little water. Cactuses are able to thrive in the driest desert conditions because they're xerophytes.", "long": "The Greek roots of xerophyte are xeros, \"dry,\" and phyton, \"a plant.\" Botanists use this term for species that have adapted to thrive in conditions that would quickly kill other plants. It makes perfect sense that a cactus in a barren desert falls into this category, but it may be surprising to learn that pineapples are also xerophytes, with shallow roots and curved leaves adapted to send any moisture into the plant's center."}
