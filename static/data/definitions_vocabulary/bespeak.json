{"short": "To bespeak is to imply or signal something, the way your neighbor's electric car might bespeak concern for the environment.", "long": "You can use this verb to mean \"indicate\" or \"convey indirectly.\" Your city's excellent schools and smooth, well-cared-for streets may bespeak high taxes to people who are considering buying a house there. Your interest in foreign films and philosophy might bespeak a deep intelligence and curiosity to your teachers. And if you're really paying attention, you'll realize your friend's crankiness bespeaks her fear of starting at a new school next fall."}
