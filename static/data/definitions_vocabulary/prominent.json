{"short": "If you're looking for an adjective that means \"sticking out above the rest; famous,\" consider prominent. A prominent person might be the big star, the head honcho, the top dog \u2014 not just any ordinary person.", "long": "A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means \"sticking out\" either in a literal sense (\"a prominent nose\") or a figurative one (\"a prominent figure in the industry\"). The metaphorical sense of \"famous\" is the most common one today, so you're more likely to hear about prominent people than prominent noses."}
