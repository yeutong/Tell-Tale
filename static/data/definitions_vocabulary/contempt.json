{"short": "Reserve the noun contempt for an extreme lack of respect: a food snob has nothing but contempt for mass-produced burgers and fries at a fast-food joint.", "long": "Contempt has nothing to do with the verb condemn, despite the similarity in sound and meaning; it is from Latin temnere \"to despise,\" and if you despise someone, you have contempt for them. It's a harsh term and should be used with care; it's stronger than either disdain or scorn.  It suggests you find someone or something utterly worthless. That food snob might say the words \"Big Mac\" or \"Whopper\" with a voice dripping in contempt."}
