{"short": "Something that is fleeting or short-lived is ephemeral, like a fly that lives for one day or text messages flitting from cellphone to cellphone.", "long": "Ephemeral (\u0259-FEM-\u0259r-\u0259l) was originally a medical term with the specific meaning \"lasting only one day,\" as a fever or sickness (Hemera means \"day\" in Greek.) The word became more general, coming to mean \"lasting a short time,\" covering the life spans of plants or insects and then eventually anything that is fleeting or transitory. A related word is the plural noun ephemera, meaning \"things that are meant to last for only a short time.\" Posters for a rock concert are often ephemera, unless the band is so famous that they get saved and sold on eBay."}
