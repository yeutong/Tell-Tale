{"short": "Unlike a pickle or a chipmunk, a human is a person. You can identify a human by the two legs it stands on, its upright stature, its high intelligence, and its speech that you'll understand if you're one, too.", "long": "Human was first recorded in the mid 13th century, and owes its existence to the Middle French humain \u201cof or belonging to man.\u201d That word, in turn, comes from the Latin humanus, thought to be a hybrid relative of homo, meaning \u201cman,\u201d and humus, meaning \u201cearth.\u201d Thus, a human, unlike birds, planes, or even divine spirits up above, is a man firmly rooted to the earth."}
