{"short": "Put simply, your sovereign is your king or queen. George III was the sovereign of Great Britain and her colonies \u2014 including the American ones. At least he was until a little thing called the Revolutionary War upset everything.", "long": "Sovereign as an adjective can be used to indicate the ultimate power of a state, whether a monarchy or not, as in \"Peru exercised its sovereign rights to all minerals within its borders.\" A sovereign is also a British gold coin with a face value of one pound sterling (with the monarch's face on it). But don't sell it for a pound, because it's worth its weight in gold \u2014 quite literally \u2014 which is a lot more than a pound is worth."}
