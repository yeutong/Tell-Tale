{"short": "When you have a misapprehension, you make a mistake trying to understand something, which leads you to believe something that isn't true. You may have a misapprehension about your brother's motives for being so nice to you this week.", "long": "You may have an uncle who is famous for his misapprehension of luck and probability, which must be why he\u2019s lost so much money gambling. He also has a misapprehension of geography, so he thinks he can get from his house in Maryland to your house in New Hampshire in under four hours \u2014 by bus! No one ever said your uncle was stupid \u2014 he just has a misapprehension of some basic things that the rest of the family gets."}
