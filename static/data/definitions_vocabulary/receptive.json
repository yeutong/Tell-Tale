{"short": "To be receptive is to be open to new ideas or change. If you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re responsive to other people\u014c\u0106\u00d6s suggestions and not set in your ways, then you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re not only receptive, but flexible.", "long": "The adjective receptive actually comes from a Latin word that means receive. So a receptive person is willing to receive things, especially opposing arguments, constructive criticism, and helpful hints. How receptive you are speaks to your willingness to have an impression made upon you. It can be good to be large and in charge sometimes, but you can also benefit from stepping back and being receptive to what life brings."}
