{"short": "Anything canned is stored in a jar or can. It\u2019s usually food, but prerecorded music is also canned. And, if you get fired from a job, you\u2019ve been canned. Don\u2019t cry, though, it\u2019s better than being stuck in a jar.", "long": "When someone talks about \"canned goods,\" they mean all the food you can buy that comes in a can, like canned green beans and canned pineapple. Home-preserved food is also canned, even if it's in a glass jar. This adjective takes on a derogatory slant when it describes music that's recorded rather than played live, or an answer that sounds prepared rather than real."}
