{"short": "When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it\u0101\u0080\u0099s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.", "long": "Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool\u0101\u0080\u00a6well that\u0101\u0080\u0099s not a cogent argument; it\u0101\u0080\u0099s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature."}
