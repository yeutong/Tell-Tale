{"short": "If you are excessively enthusiastic about something \u014c\u0106\u00f6 a sports team, an actor, your religion, saving the whales, a certain brand of chocolate \u014c\u0106\u00f6 then you are fanatical about it.", "long": "Fanatical comes from the word fanatic, which itself came from the Latin fanaticus, meaning \"mad\" or \"inspired by a deity.\" The root word is fanum, or \"temple.\" The original English meanings of both fanatic and fanatical implied that the person being described was insane with enthusiasm, like a religious zealot. The word fan is likely shortened from fanatic, and thus shares the same roots, but that word doesn't imply the same obsessiveness that fanatical does."}
