{"short": "When speech or writing is not literal, it is figurative, like when you say you have a ton of homework. You don't really have 2000 pounds of homework, do you? Also, when art depicts a figure from life it is figurative, like a figurative drawing of a dancer.", "long": "The adjective figurative comes from the Old French word figuratif, which means \u201cmetaphorical.\u201d  Any figure of speech \u2014 a statement or phrase not intended to be understood literally \u2014 is figurative. You say your hands are frozen, or you are so hungry you could eat a horse. That's being figurative. In art, figure means \"human or animal form,\" so a figurative drawing might show horses running across a field."}
