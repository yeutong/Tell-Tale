{"short": "Consider expanding your vocabulary by a small increment, or increase, each day. Increasing your vocabulary by an increment of just two words a day means you\u0101\u0080\u0099ll learn more than 700 new words a year!", "long": "Increment is often used in the context of a series of regular increases, so this word comes in handy whenever you\u0101\u0080\u0099re expanding or improving something over time. Maybe you contribute to your bank account in modest increments each week. Or, when working out at the gym, perhaps you increase the number of sit-ups you do by a small increment each day."}
