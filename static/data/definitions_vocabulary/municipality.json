{"short": "If you live in a town or city that has a mayor or other officials who govern it, you live in a  municipality.", "long": "The word municipality comes from the Latin municipium, meaning \"free city.\" A municipality has its own government, but sometimes municipalities join together to share services. For instance, two neighboring municipalities might decide to share a single recycling center in order to cut costs."}
