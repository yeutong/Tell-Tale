{"short": "An axiom is a self-evident truth. The authors of the Declaration of Independence could have written, \u014c\u0106\u00a3We hold these truths to be axiomatic,\u014c\u0106\u00d8 but it wouldn't have the same ring.", "long": "The root word of axiomatic, axiom, derives from the Greek axioma, meaning \"authority,\" or \"that which is thought worthy or fit.\" We use it to describe statements that have the authority of truth about them, or that seem worthy of the truth, or fit to be described as such. That is, an axiom is a proposition that we don\u014c\u0106\u00d6t generally question because it seems plain enough that it\u014c\u0106\u00d6s true. And axiomatic means evident without proof or argument."}
