{"short": "When something is monolithic it's big, and made of one thing. A large piece of stone jutting from the earth is a monolith, and Detroit's economy when it depended entirely on the auto industry was monolithic.", "long": "Broken into its roots mono and lithic, monolithic means simply \"one stone.\" When monolithic is used to describe something societal \u2014 like a religion or an organization \u2014 it has a slightly negative connotation. For example, a monolithic society is rigid and homogenous, not open to new ideas. Being monolithic is good for rocks, but not so good for groups of people."}
