{"short": "If someone's rude without being openly nasty, like a kid in the back row of class quietly heckling his teacher, you can call him impertinent.", "long": "Impertinent originally meant just what it sounds like, \"not pertinent, irrelevant,\" but it also came to mean \"inappropriate, out of place\" and therefore \"intrusive, presumptuous; behaving without proper respect; insolent.\" It still carries a condescending air, so it's best used of or to a child being snippy to a grownup: \"Don't be impertinent!\" The stress is on the second syllable: im-PERT-inent."}
