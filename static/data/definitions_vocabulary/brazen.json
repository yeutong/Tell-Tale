{"short": "With brazen disregard for the sign that said \"No Cellphones,\" the woman took a long call in the dentist's waiting room, irritating the other patients. Brazen describes something shocking or done shamelessly.", "long": "The Middle English word was brasen, \"made of brass,\" from Old English br\u00e6s, \"brass.\" In its literal sense, this word can mean \"made of or resembling brass,\" as in a brazen drinking cup from a medieval castle. It can also mean overly or disrespectfully bold. A near synonym of brazen is our English word brassy, which has the additional meaning of being loud and showy."}
