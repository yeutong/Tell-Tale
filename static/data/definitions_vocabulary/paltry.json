{"short": "A paltry amount is so small it's not even worth thinking about. In the novel Oliver Twist, when Oliver is given a paltry amount of gruel \u014c\u0106\u00f6 not nearly enough \u014c\u0106\u00f6 he asks, \"Please, sir, can I have some more?\"", "long": "Paltry is a laughably small amount \u014c\u0106\u00f6 the waiter might chuck a paltry tip in the garbage. If you have only 50 cents in your bank account, it's such a paltry amount, you may as well be broke. It can also mean \"not worth considering\" or \"not important.\" If you keep breaking your promises, your friends will get sick of your paltry excuses."}
