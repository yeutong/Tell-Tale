{"short": "If you give your best friend a bracelet for her birthday, then you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re a good friend. If you give her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re a munificent friend, meaning you are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it\u014c\u0106\u00d6s possible you may also be broke.)", "long": "If you\u014c\u0106\u00d6re the generous type, you may already know that the word munificent traces back to the Latin word munificus, meaning \u014c\u0106\u00a3generous or bountiful,\" which in turn originated from the word munus, meaning \u014c\u0106\u00a3gift or service.\u014c\u0106\u00d8 Put those two concepts together and you have big-time gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word munificent to describe instances of over-the-top generosity \u014c\u0106\u00f6 think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at Christmastime."}
