{"short": "If you spot something, you descry it. When you spy it, you descry it. It's a good verb to use when you catch a glimpse of a rare bird in the trees. Or when you finally spot Waldo in a Where's Waldo? book.", "long": "Descry is very similar to \"see\" or \"discern,\" but involves more than just keeping your eyes open. Usually you descry something after observing carefully for a while. Wrote Ovid, the Ancient Roman poet and author: \u201cTime on time revolving we descry, so moments flit, so moments fly.\u201d Apparently, even in antiquity people complained about seeing the time go by too quickly."}
