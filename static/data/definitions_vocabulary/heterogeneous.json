{"short": "Heterogeneous can be used to describe the diversity of nearly anything \u2014 populations, classrooms, collections. A heterogeneous array of immigrants passed through Ellis Island to help create the American \"melting pot.\"", "long": "An easy way to remember the meaning of this word is that homo is the same and hetero is different. So, a homogeneous group of puppies might consist of apricot-colored poodles, while a heterogeneous group might consist of a hodgepodge of different pups ranging from dachshunds to dalmatians. Anytime you are confronted with a group whose members are not all similar to one another, you have an opportunity to trot out heterogeneous."}
