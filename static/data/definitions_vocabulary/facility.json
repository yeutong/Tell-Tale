{"short": "Facility is a noun with several different meanings. Often, as in \"storage facility,\" it's a place designed for a specific use, but it can also mean an effortlessness or ease with something.", "long": "The new stadium is a great facility for showing off Olympic winter sports. At this level, all of the ice skaters show a facility that borders on magical. Likewise, the prison is a great facility for storing prisoners. Those prisoners showed a real facility for crime. Related to the French facile, which means \"easy,\" a person who shows a facility for something makes it seem easy. This is cool, especially if that thing is difficult \u2014 or, as the French might say, difficile."}
