{"short": "If an executive gives a speech that begins, \"This business is all about survival of the fittest. You need to burn the midnight oil and take one for the team,\" his employees might get sick of listening to these meaningless clich\u00e9s and tell him to cut the platitudes.", "long": "The English language contains many old, worn-out clich\u00e9s, or platitudes. Phrases like \"ants in your pants\" and \"as American as apple pie\" are so overused that they've almost lost their meaning. People rely on these tired old remarks when they can't think of anything original to say. Be warned: if you throw too many platitudes into your conversations, people are eventually going to get tired of listening to you."}
