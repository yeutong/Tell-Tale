{"short": "Fictitious means made up, or imaginary. No matter how real Scarlett O'Hara might seem in \"Gone With the Wind,\" she's a fictitious character invented by author Margaret Mitchell.", "long": "When you look at the word fictitious, you'll probably notice that it bears a striking resemblance to fiction \u2014 which is an imaginary story about people and events that are made up for the purpose of entertaining readers. Fictitious can also be used to mean \"trick or deceive.\" A thief assumes a fictitious name to hide his real identity and evade capture."}
