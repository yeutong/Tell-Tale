{"short": "Dear diary, you are a written record of things that happen each day. Some people keep a diary while they\u2019re traveling, others keep their secrets in a diary. Either way, keep out!", "long": "Some diaries have a pretty cover and a tiny lock with a key, for keeping the contents safe from prying eyes. You can also call such a book a \"journal,\" although traditionally a diary is written in each day, while a journal might have less frequent entries. The word diary comes from the Latin word diarium, \"daily allowance,\" with its root of dies, or \"day.\""}
