{"short": "A prerogative is someone's special right or privilege. As Bobby Brown once sang, \"I don't need permission / Make my own decisions / That's my prerogative.\"", "long": "Prerogative goes back to a Latin root for a group having the right to vote first (prae-, \"pre-\" + rogare, \"to ask\") and thus came to mean \"privileged rank.\" In current use, it refers to a right or privilege held by any person or group. A near synonym is privilege, which puts more emphasis on the fact that others do not have it. The self-justifying phrase \"That's my prerogative\" (for example, in reference to changing one's mind) is quite common."}
