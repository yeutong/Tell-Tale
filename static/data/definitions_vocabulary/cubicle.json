{"short": "A cubicle is a small space partitioned off within a larger space for a particular purpose \u00e2\u20ac\u201d usually reading or studying. Or just surfing the Internet.", "long": "Cubicle comes from the Latin term for a monk's bedroom, cubiculum, which itself is from the word cubare, \"to lie down.\" Back then a monk would probably share it with an illuminated manuscript and a Bible; nowadays the average worker drone has a computer and a bunch of Post-it notes. Still great for sleeping in, though, as long as you don't get caught."}
