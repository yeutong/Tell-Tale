{"short": "Acquiescence is an agreement, usually a willingness to go along with what someone else suggests. \"Sure, I don't mind,\" \"That sounds like a plan,\" and \"Good idea\" \u0101\u0080\u0094 these are all ways to show your acquiescence.", "long": "The word acquiescence, pronounced \"ack-we-ESS-sense,\" comes from the French word of the same spelling. The first record of its meaning as \"silent consent\" occurred in the 1640s. Acquiescence, in addition to \"agreement,\" can also mean \"acceptance without protest.\" Often when you offer acquiescence, you give in to another person's plan, perhaps because you are afraid to object or you don't have a better idea of your own."}
