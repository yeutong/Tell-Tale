{"short": "The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance.", "long": "Countenance comes from a French word for \"behavior,\" but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: \"He had a puzzled countenance,\" or \"what a charming countenance!\" Countenance can also be a verb meaning to tolerate or approve. If someone does something offensive, tell them, \"I'm afraid I can't countenance that.\""}
