{"short": "If you're privy to something, you've been let in on a secret or know about something that most people don't. Not many people are privy to what those top secret documents are all about, for example.", "long": "The adjective privy comes from the Latin privatus, meaning \u201cprivate,\u201d and describes someone who has knowledge of secret or confidential information. But watch out: If you use privy as a noun, it can mean \u201couthouse\u201d or \u201ctoilet,\u201d which actually might be a good place to hide your diary if you don't want anyone else to be privy to its contents."}
