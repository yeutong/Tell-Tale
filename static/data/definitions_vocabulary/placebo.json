{"short": "A patient's symptoms sometimes disappear just because they believe that they are being treated. Even when doctors give them a biologically inactive drug, otherwise known as a placebo, the patients swear they are cured.", "long": "In clinical drug-trials, to rule out what is called the placebo effect, scientists give half of the trial participants a placebo. If a government replaces food stamps with a coloring book give-away, it might be dismissed by child advocates as nothing more than a placebo. Plac\u0113b\u014d is Latin for \"I'll please (you),\" in other words, I'll keep you happy, even though I'm just giving you a placebo."}
