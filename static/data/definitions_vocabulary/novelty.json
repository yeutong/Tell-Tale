{"short": "Novelty is a newness or refreshing quality. Many college freshmen enjoy the novelty of living on their own \u2014 until it comes time to do that first load of laundry.", "long": "You'll often hear people talk about the novelty of a new experience \u2014  imagine the excitement and anticipation of cracking open a novel you\u2019ve never read before to help remember the word. But novelty is also a term for a small toy or trinket, usually mass-produced. Novelty shops sell all kinds of funny knickknacks, from personalized flashlight key chains to stuffed singing hamsters."}
