At the end of an oral report, you might say, \"So, to recapitulate, I've made three points,\" and then you name them.", "long": "Recapitulate is a long, scary-looking word that actually means something simple and easy. It comes from the Latin re- \"again\" and capitulum \"chapter,\" which comes from the word caput \"head.\" Think of recapitulating\u2013\u2013or recapping, for short\u2013\u2013as putting nice little caps on all the bottles you've opened up\u2013\u2013tightening everything up."}
