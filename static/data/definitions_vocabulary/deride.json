{"short": "The verb deride means to speak to someone with contempt or show a low opinion of someone or something. A bully might constantly deride other kids in his class \u014c\u0106\u00f6 which might lead to many afternoons spent in the principal's office.", "long": "To \"ride\" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root d\u2500\u014dr\u2500\u00bdd\u2500\u014dre, meaning \"to ridicule, to scorn,\" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns."}
