{"short": "Earthquakes have great magnitude in that they are powerful. Their power is rated by their level of magnitude, or how much energy they release relative to other earthquakes.", "long": "In math, magnitude compares numbers by powers of 10. If your weekly allowance was $10, but your brother's was $100, his allowance would be one order of magnitude higher than yours. If your sister's was $10,000, hers would be three orders of magnitude higher. A difference of that magnitude is just not fair!"}
