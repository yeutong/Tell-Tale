{"short": "An autocracy is a government controlled by one person with absolute power. As unlimited power doesn't usually bring out the best in people, autocracies are often brutal regimes.", "long": "The word autocracy comes from the Greek roots auto (\"self\") and kratos (\"power\"). If your boss dictates your every move and leaves you no say at all in how you do your work, then you're not in a democratic workplace, you're in an autocracy."}
