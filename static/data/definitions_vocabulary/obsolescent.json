{"short": "Recycling bins, garbage dumps, and junkyards are filled with obsolescent stuff \u014c\u0106\u00f6 computers, televisions, cars, and everything else that's discarded because it's not the latest thing anymore.", "long": "The word obsolescent is closely related to obsolete and the words are often used interchangeably. Actually, though, the -sc- in obsolescent means \"becoming.\" So, if you're going to use the word carefully, you can talk about your obsolescent computer that still lumbers along but will soon be obsolete and completely useless."}
