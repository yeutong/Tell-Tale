It can also refer to a material that sticks to other things.  While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases, the word comes from the Latin root haer\u0113re \"stick,\" connected to the prefix ad- \"to,\" making the word mean \"to stick to.\""}
