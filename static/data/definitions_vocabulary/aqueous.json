{"short": "When something has an aqueous appearance, it looks watery or has the effect of water. Some marble can appear aqueous or have a watery-looking surface pattern.", "long": "The word aqueous comes from the Latin aqua meaning \"water.\" If you flip over a product package and read its ingredients, often you'll see water listed at the top, which means that whatever is inside is an aqueous solution, or one that contains water. Salt water is an example of an aqueous solution because salt easily dissolves in water. Essentially, something aqueous either resembles water or is made from water."}
