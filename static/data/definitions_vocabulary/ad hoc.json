{"short": "If you call an ad hoc meeting of your knitting buddies, it means the meeting was formed for one particular reason \u0101\u0080\u0094 to knit. Anything ad hoc is either done for one specific purpose, or in an impromptu, last-minute way.", "long": "Ad hoc comes from the Latin words meaning \"for this.\" Often the term is used as a criticism, in the sense that something done ad hoc is done hastily and can be ill thought out, serving only to address a problem in the short term. Government programs are often described as ad hoc, for example. But the term can also imply a sense of ingenuity, of impromptu brilliance, or of something happily care-free and devoid of fuss. Like your ad hoc knitting event!"}
