{"short": "A manuscript is a handwritten work. It's still a manuscript if it's typed \u2014 if a publisher asks for your manuscript, don't send her something scrawled on notebook paper!", "long": "The noun manuscript evolved from the Latin manu scriptus, meaning \u201cwritten by hand.\u201d Manu is \u201chand\u201d and scriptus is \u201cto write.\" It refers to old documents actually written by hand before books were made, but it can also refer to a writer's unpublished work whether it's handwritten or typed. Samuel Johnson said, \u201cYour manuscript is both good and original, but the part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good.\u201d Harrumph!"}
