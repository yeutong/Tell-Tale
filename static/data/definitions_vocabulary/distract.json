{"short": "Distract is what you do when you draw someone\u2019s attention \u2014 Hey! Look! Over there! Oh. Never mind. What was I saying? That\u2019s right: distract is to draw attention away from what someone is doing.", "long": "Distract comes from the Latin word for \u201cdraw apart.\u201d It can be annoying when someone or something distracts you. A loud car alarm or a talkative friend might distract you when you\u2019re watching your favorite TV show. But being distracted is not always bad. Playing a round of miniature golf might distract you from feeling sad about the death of your parakeet."}
