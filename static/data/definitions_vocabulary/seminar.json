{"short": "A seminar means a class or meeting, but it carries with it extra weight.  An educational  seminar indicates a small, advanced study, while a meeting labeled as such means an intense exchange of ideas.", "long": "The Latin seminarium originally referred to a plant nursery, a place of great growth. From this came the German seminar, referring to a formal educational group led by a professor.  While university seminars are most frequently small-group studies of a particular issue, the word is also applied to large lectures and commercial pitches. Like the seminar you attended on how to get rich by selling carrot peelers to your neighbors."}
