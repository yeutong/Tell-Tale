If your really boring teacher suddenly starts throwing M&Ms to every student with a correct answer, he will energize the classroom.", "long": "Ever seen the Energizer Bunny\u2013\u2013the one who \"keeps going and going and going?\" It's because he's energized by long-lasting batteries that he has the energy to beat that drum over and over. Someone who's feeling low on energy might be reenergized by a cat nap or a candy bar."}
