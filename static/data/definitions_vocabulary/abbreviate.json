{"short": "To abbreviate is to shorten. Words are often abbreviated, like when we say sked instead of schedule.", "long": "Though we most often think about words being abbreviated \u2014 especially terms like OMG and LOL for \"oh my God\" and \"laugh out loud\" \u2014 lots of things can be abbreviated. You just have to shorten them. Sudden rain might abbreviate a baseball game. A bomb threat would abbreviate a school day. Anytime something is being shortened or cut, abbreviation is going on."}
