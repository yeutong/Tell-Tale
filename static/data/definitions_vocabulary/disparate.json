{"short": "The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very different from each other.", "long": "Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin dispar\u0101tus, from dispar\u0101re \"to separate, divide,\" from the prefix dis- \"apart\" plus par\u0101re \"to prepare.\" Disparate in the sense of \"very different\" probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar \"unequal, different.\""}
