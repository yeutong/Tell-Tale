{"short": "If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly honest assessment of your friend's new haircut.", "long": "Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning \"back,\" and the verb cantare, meaning \"to sing.\" It has been suggested that recant was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant \u2014 unless you've been casting nasty spells on people."}
