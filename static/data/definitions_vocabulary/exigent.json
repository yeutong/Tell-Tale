{"short": "When you describe something as exigent, you are saying it requires attention: it can't be ignored.", "long": "Exigent, which means \"demanding attention,\" comes from the Latin for \"driving out.\" If there's a runaway train driving straight at you, that's an exigent situation \u2014 not a good time to stop and write a poem.  When circumstances become exigent, it's time to act.  When exigent questions arise, an answer is necessary.  You can also use exigent for a person who demands attention, usually by complaining.  If you've ever worked as a waiter, you've surely dealt with an exigent customer."}
