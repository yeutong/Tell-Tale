{"short": "Use the adjective unobtrusive to describe something that doesn\u0101\u0080\u0099t attract much attention, like an unobtrusive waiter who doesn't interrupt diners to rattle off the nightly specials, or an unobtrusive stain on the floor that your parents haven't noticed.", "long": "When you need to blend in, look to the word unobtrusive, which is pronounced \"un-ob-TROO-sive.\" Unobtrusive can describe anyone \u0101\u0080\u0094 or anything \u0101\u0080\u0094 that is not very noticeable, such as the unobtrusive black parka that makes you look more or less like everyone else on the city streets in winter, or the unobtrusive security cameras at your bank."}
