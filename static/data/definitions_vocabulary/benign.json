{"short": "Someone or something that is benign is gentle, kind, mild, or unharmful: a benign soul wouldn't hurt a fly.", "long": "Benign describes a range of qualities, all of them positive. When talking about a person, it means \"gentle.\" In reference to weather or climate, it means \"mild.\" In some other contexts, it simply means \"not harmful\" \u2014 you might speak of \"a benign tumor\" or \"an environmentally benign chemical.\" The word comes from a Latin root benignus meaning \"well born,\" but the implied meaning is \"kind\" or \"pleasant\" \u2014 it's hard to get mad at someone who has a benign disposition."}
