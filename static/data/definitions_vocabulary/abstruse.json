{"short": "Abstruse things are difficult to understand because they are so deep and intellectually challenging. It might be hard to figure out how the inside of a wristwatch works with all the tiny, complicated pieces but something abstruse is much harder to grasp, like the quantum mechanics applied to making atomic clocks for navigational purposes.", "long": "The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding something, which is a good way to remember the meaning of this word. It is useful when describing something that is overly confusing, or if someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is almost its opposite. Obtuse is dull or lacking a sharpness of intellect. While Abstruse is president of the chess club, Obtuse is hanging out by the parking lot smoking cigarettes."}
