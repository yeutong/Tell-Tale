{"short": "Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.", "long": "For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means \"to go astray,\" from the prefix ab- \"off, away\" plus errare \"to wander.\"  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected."}
