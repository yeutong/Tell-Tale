{"short": "Eloquence is powerful, moving, magnificent use of language. Simply put, if you have eloquence, then you're one smooth talker.", "long": "The noun eloquence has roots in the Latin word eloqui, meaning to \"speak out.\" But we're not talking about just any regular speech here. Eloquence is marked by fluency, persuasiveness, and the power to stir emotions. The eloquence of your dog trainer\u2019s empowering speech about the need for complementary manicures and pedicures for pets might bring you to tears, for example."}
