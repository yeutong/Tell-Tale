{"short": "You've heard the old saying \"Pride comes before the fall?\" Well, you could just as easily say pride is a precursor to the fall. A precursor is something that happens before something else.", "long": "You don't have to be a dead languages scholar to guess that this word springs from a Latin source \u2014 praecursor, \"to run before.\" A precursor is usually related to what it precedes. It's a catalyst or a harbinger, leading to what follows or providing a clue that it's going to happen. Binging on holiday candy is a precursor to tummy aches and promises to exercise more. Draconian policies in unstable nations are often a precursor to rebellion."}
