{"short": "The adjective tumultuous means disruptive, troubled, or disorderly \u014c\u0106\u00f6 like the tumultuous state of an unruly classroom after the teacher has stepped out for a few minutes.", "long": "You might hear the adjective tumultuous in news stories about riots because it's one of the best words to describe a group of people in turmoil or disorder, but it can mean anything in a state of unrest. For example, you might steer your boat into a safe harbor before a heavy storm, so the tumultuous waves won't sweep you onto the rocks."}
