{"short": "To perspire is to sweat: to excrete perspiration through the pores in your skin.", "long": "Whenever little drops of moisture appear on your skin, you're perspiring or sweating. People sweat when they're nervous, when it's hot out, and when they're doing a lot of exercise. If you watch people playing a strenuous sport like basketball, they will be perspiring. Perspiring is one way your body cools itself off, so sweating is a good thing, even though it can make you feel gross. Some animals \u2014 like dogs \u2014 can't perspire, so it's harder for them to cool off."}
