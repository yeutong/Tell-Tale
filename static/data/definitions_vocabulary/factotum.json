{"short": "If you're running late and still need to iron your clothes and make breakfast, but can't find your shoes, you may wish you had a factotum, or a servant who does a variety of odd jobs for their employer.", "long": "Factotum sounds like the two words \u201cfact\u201d and \u201ctotem\u201d spliced together, but this curious noun originally comes from the Latin words that mean \"do\" and \"everything.\" In current times, since servants aren\u2019t typical anymore, we might call someone who has a paid job like this a jack-of-all-trades or possibly a personal assistant."}
