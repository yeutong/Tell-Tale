{"short": "Something remarkable is unusual, exceptional, interesting, or excellent. Remarkable things get your attention.", "long": "If you take this word literally, you can figure out the meaning: remarkable things make you want to make a remark about them. They get you talking because they're so unusual or good. Getting a B on a test isn't remarkable, unless you usually get D\u2019s. Getting to meet the president would be pretty remarkable. Save this word for things that are really and truly exceptional."}
