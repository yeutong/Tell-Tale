{"short": "Looking truly magnificent today? Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say \"Wow! You look splendid, darling!\" Thanks the person, because splendid means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.", "long": "Use the adjective splendid to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond, splendid! But splendid doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid!"}
