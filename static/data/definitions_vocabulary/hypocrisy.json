{"short": "People who tell you not to eat candy while they chomp away on licorice all day? People who say they hate cars but always beg you for a ride? They are engaging in hypocrisy, or behavior that is different from what they say they believe.", "long": "A hypocrite is a person who practices hypocrisy: what they say is not what they do. The noun hypocrisy descends from the Greek hypokrisis \"acting on a stage,\" from hypokrinesthai \"to play a part, pretend,\" from the prefix hypo- \"under\" plus  krinein \"to judge.\" Many times kids are enraged by their parents' hypocrisy when parents make their children follow rules they don't follow themselves."}
