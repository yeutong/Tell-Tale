{"short": "Use the adjective evocative when you want to describe something that reminds you of something else. If your mom baked a lot when you were a kid, the smell of cookies in the oven is probably evocative of your childhood.", "long": "Evocative comes from the Latin word evocare, which means to \"call out\" or \"summon.\"  Think of a batch of cookies summoning a memory from your childhood. To summon something you need a voice, and indeed, the Latin word for voice is vocare.  Other related words include the noun vocation, which means \"a calling.\""}
