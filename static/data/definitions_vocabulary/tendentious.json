{"short": "If you are writing a report on climate change and you ignore evidence that the earth is warming, the paper might be called tendentious. Tendentious means promoting a specific, and controversial, point of view.", "long": "When something is tendentious, it shows a bias towards a particular point of view, especially one that people disagree about. It shares a root with the word tendency, which means \"an inclination toward acting a certain way.\" If you have the tendency to talk in a tendentious manner about politics, people might tend to avoid you at parties."}
