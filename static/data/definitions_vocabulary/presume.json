If you are presumed to be the fastest runner, don't get too cocky \u0101\u0080\u0094 that word implies that you haven't actually raced yet.", "long": "To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote \u0101\u0080\u009cDr. Livingstone, I presume?\u0101\u0080\u009d comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in 1871. It\u0101\u0080\u0099s funny because these were the only two white men known to be in that part of Africa at the time."}
