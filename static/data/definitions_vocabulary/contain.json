{"short": "The verb contain has many shades of meaning but it often describes something that's held back or held in by something. Kids on the last day of school may find it hard to contain their glee when summer officially starts.", "long": "Picture Times Square on New Year's Eve. People can barely contain \u2014 or hold back \u2014 their excitement at being there. They clutch cups that contain \u2014 or hold \u2014 hot drinks that help them stay warm. The police set up barriers to contain \u2014 or restrain \u2014 the crowd to keep everyone under control. The next morning, the heaps of trash on the street will contain \u2014 or include \u2014 streamers, party hats, and cups."}
