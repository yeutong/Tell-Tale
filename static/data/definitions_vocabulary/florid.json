{"short": "Something that's elaborate and full of extra flourishes is florid, whether it's your relatives' ornate decorating style or the way they talk, using a lot of unnecessarily long, complicated words.", "long": "Florid is an adjective that entered English in the 17th century, via the French floride, from the Latin fl\u014dridus, \"blooming.\" You can probably guess how Florida and flourish are related! Something overly decorated, such as a fussy living room, is florid in the flowery sense, while pale-skinned people with rosy cheeks are florid because they appear to be flourishing with good health."}
