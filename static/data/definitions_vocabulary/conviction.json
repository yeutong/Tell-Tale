{"short": "A conviction is something certain: a judgment of guilty in court and a strong belief are both convictions.", "long": "In the legal world, when a judge or jury convicts someone of a crime \u2014 finding them guilty \u2014 this is called a conviction. Prosecutors try to get convictions, and defense attorneys try to prevent them. Also, convictions are beliefs \u2014 principles. The United States was founded on many convictions, such as the belief in free speech and separation of church and state. When you have a conviction, you're certain of something."}
