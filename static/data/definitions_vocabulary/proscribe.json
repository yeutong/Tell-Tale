{"short": "To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class.", "long": "Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor\u2019s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words \u2014 but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people\u2019s value systems. And it would also be bad for your health."}
