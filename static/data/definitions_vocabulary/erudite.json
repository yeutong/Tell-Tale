{"short": "If you call someone erudite, that means they show great learning. After you've earned your second Ph.D., you will be truly erudite.", "long": "Erudite is from Latin verb erudire, \"to teach,\" which comes from rudis for \"raw, unskilled, ignorant\" (the source of our word rude). If you bring someone out of a raw state, you educate them, so someone who is erudite is very educated indeed (and perhaps a bit of a showoff).  You can say either ER-oo-dite or ER-yoo-dite; the second one, being a bit harder to say, can seem a bit more erudite."}
