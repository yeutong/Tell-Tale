{"short": "Sarcastic humor mocks or ridicules, usually by saying the opposite of what is actually meant. The talent-show judge who rolls his eyes at your dancing, smirks, and says, \"You ought to be on Broadway\" is a sarcastic person.", "long": "Sarcastic comes from the Greek word sarkazhein, which literally means \"tear the flesh.\" Maybe that's why we also refer to our talent-show judge's remark as \"cutting.\" When someone's being sarcastic, sometimes it's the tone, facial expression, or body language that let you know \u2014 like when our talent-show judge says exaggeratedly, \"Great job! I almost confused you for Pavarotti,\" as he gives you a thumbs-down."}
