You'll often hear about partisan politics in the U.S. \u0101\u0080\u0094 since politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.", "long": "Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or \u0101\u0080\u0094 more rarely it seems to American voters \u0101\u0080\u0094 the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix bi is added to show the support from both parties."}
