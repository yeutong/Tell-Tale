{"short": "If you have a place that's all your own, somewhere real or in cyberspace that has your name all over it \u2014 literally or figuratively \u2014 it's your domain. And if you have something you really excel at, that is your domain too. You own it.", "long": "A domain used to mean only land owned by wealthy people, such as lords in the 15th century, but modern usage is much wider, or has a broader domain in the English language. On the Internet, a domain is a space with a specific address, but a domain can also have a physical address, like a home. It can be a specialty, too, as in, \"The main domain of the art school was sculpture,\" or \"She was so good at math that algebra became her domain.\""}
