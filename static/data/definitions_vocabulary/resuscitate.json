{"short": "To resuscitate is to revive a person who has lost consciousness. In recent years it's become important for people to learn CPR so that they might resuscitate someone who loses consciousness, and many schools and hospitals offer classes in CPR.", "long": "The Latin word suscit\u0101re, \"to raise,\" combines with re-, \"again,\" to create the base of the verb resuscitate. Through the years, methods of resuscitation have advanced to the current sophisticated and effective levels of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, and defibrillation paddles that can shock a heart back to life. In fact, some patients nowadays ask to sign a \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) order to allow them to die without medical interventions like resuscitation."}
