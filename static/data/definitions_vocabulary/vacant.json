{"short": "You can use the adjective vacant to describe something that is empty \u2014 an apartment with no tenant or furniture, a job with no worker, or a person with no brainpower.", "long": "Vacant has its roots in the Latin word meaning \u201cempty\u201d or \u201cfree.\u201d It can mean \u201cunoccupied,\u201d such as that seat next to you on the train \u2014 even if you\u2019ve put your coat there. A vacant look or stare, however, is one that shows no intelligence or the slightest spark of interest. One might find this vacant gaze in the eyes of a zombie or in the eyes of a teen who has spent the past five hours gaming."}
