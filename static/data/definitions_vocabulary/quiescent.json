{"short": "The adjective quiescent means \"being quiet and still,\" like the quiescent moments lying in a hammock on a beautiful summer Sunday.", "long": "To be quiescent, pronounced \"qwhy-ESS-ent,\" is to be quiet, resting, which is exactly what its Latin origin quiescens means: In our busy world, it is hard to find a place to be quiescent. It has a second meaning: \"causing no symptoms.\" For example, if a disease is quiescent, you probably won't know you have it. And finally, quiescent can mean \"not activated,\" like quiescent cleaning products that don't get the stains out."}
