{"short": "A rectangle is any shape with four sides and four right angles.  All squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares (all the sides in a square have to be the same length).", "long": "The rect in rectangle comes from the Latin rectus, which means \"right\" or \"straight.\" Because of its right angles, a rectangle has straight sides.  Another word with the same root is rectitude, which means moral uprightness.  A morally upright person is someone who does the right thing, but doing the right thing doesn't make you a square \u2014 or a rectangle."}
