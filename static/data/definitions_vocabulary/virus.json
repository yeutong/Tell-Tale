{"short": "Whether in the human body or on a computer, a virus is a disease-causing agent. If you come down with a nasty stomach virus, be sure to drink lots of water, get lots of rest, and stay near the toilet.", "long": "Virus comes from a Latin word that was spelled the same way. It specifically referred to the poisonous sap of certain plants, which explains why it sounds similar to viscous, a word meaning \"sticky.\"  Nowadays, it\u2019s used to describe something that causes infectious diseases, specifically a tiny, self-replicating agent made up of genetic material and protein."}
