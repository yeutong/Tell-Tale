{"short": "An itinerant is a person who moves from place to place, typically for work, like the itinerant preacher who moves to a new community every few years.", "long": "Itinerant is pronounced \"eye-TIN-er-ant.\" It might remind you of itinerary, the traveler's schedule that lists flights, hotel check-in times, and other plans. It's no surprise that both words come from the Latin word itinerare, meaning \"to travel.\" Itinerant was first used in the 16th century to describe circuit judges who traveled to faraway courtrooms. Today, almost anyone can be an itinerant."}
