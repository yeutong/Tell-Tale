{"short": "Seductive is an adjective that describes the fascinating magnetic pull that someone or something has, an attractive quality that tempts you in some way.", "long": "A seductive person catches your eye and won\u2019t let it go.  The word comes from the Latin seducere, meaning \u201cdraw aside.\u201d  When someone draws your attention aside from whatever you\u2019re doing, that is a seductive person.  Radio people often have seductive voices that lull you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front window in hopes that you\u2019ll be tempted to come inside and buy them."}
