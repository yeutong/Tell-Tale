{"short": "Devious describes someone who tends to lie and to trick other people. Devious credit card companies lure younger and younger people into debt with offers of low interest rates and even just free t-shirts.", "long": "Devious sometimes just describes a path that is not direct, a meaning that can be traced to the Latin adjective devius, \"out of the way,\" formed from the prefix de-, \"off\" plus via, \"way, road.\" The related English verb deviate means to do something different or unexpected, and the adjective deviant describes behavior that is not considered normal or morally correct."}
