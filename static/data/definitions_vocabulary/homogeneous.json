{"short": "If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators.", "long": "The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning \u201cof the same kind.\u201d You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning \u201csame,\u201d and genos, meaning \u201ckind, gender, race, stock.\u201d It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family\u2019s breakfast tastes as homogeneous."}
