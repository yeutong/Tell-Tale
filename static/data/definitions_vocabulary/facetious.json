{"short": "Don\u2019t take a facetious comment seriously because it\u2019s supposed to be funny. Anything facetious is a joke. If you've just won a hotdog-eating contest and someone asks if you'd like to go out for burgers, they\u2019re probably being facetious.", "long": "If you forget how to spell facetious, notice that it has all five vowels in a row. The word facetious comes from the French fac\u00e9tie, \u201cjoke,\u201d and it has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to simply mean \u201cfunny and witty,\u201d but now it often implies that someone is being inappropriately funny about a serious topic."}
