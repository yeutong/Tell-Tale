{"short": "Jeopardize means to put at risk or pose a threat. Jeopardize your career by posting silly pictures of yourself on Facebook. Jeopardize your friendships by posting silly pictures of your friends on Facebook.", "long": "Jeopardize stems from the Old French jeu parti, which literally translates to a game with divided, or even, chances.  An even chance of winning hardly seems a risky endeavor, but maybe our forefathers weren't big risk-takers. Whatever the reason, jeopardize has come to mean the act of putting yourself or something at risk, through circumstance or behavior. Think of double-jeopardy on the gameshow \"Jeopardy\" and you'll better understand what it means to jeopardize your savings."}
