{"short": "An aristocrat is someone from the ruling class, usually those with nobility, money, or both. Although not an aristocrat yourself, you may have the odd viscount on your family tree if you go back far enough.", "long": "The word aristocrat comes from the Greek word aristokratia, which itself comes from the root words aristos, meaning \"best,\" and kratos, meaning \"rule.\" So, the aristocracy was the ruling class of (supposedly) the best and noblest people, and an aristocrat was a member of that class. Today the word can also be applied to anyone with superior standing: Count Basie was an aristocrat in the jazz world."}
