{"short": "A hypocrite preaches one thing, and does another. You're a hypocrite if you criticize other people for wearing fur, but pull out your big mink jacket as soon as it gets cold.", "long": "The word hypocrite is rooted in the Greek word hypokrites, which means \u201cstage actor, pretender, dissembler.\u201d So think of a hypocrite as a person who pretends to be a certain way, but really acts and believes the total opposite. Hypocrites usually talk a big talk but fail to follow their own rules \u2014 like an outspoken vegetarian who secretly eats bacon."}
