{"short": "A superlative is the highest attainable level or degree of something. As an adjective superlative means highest in quality.", "long": "When your history test results are superlative, it means you've gotten a perfect score \u2014 you've done as well as can be done, if not better than everyone else. There are times, however, when a superlative is an exaggerated expression of praise, as when a movie reviewer gets carried away with compliments and says in January that this is \"the best film of the year.\""}
