{"short": "Dispassionate describes someone who is not getting carried away by \u014c\u0106\u00f6 or maybe not even having \u014c\u0106\u00f6 feelings. It's something you'd want to see in a surgeon, who keeps cool under pressure, but not in a romantic partner.", "long": "Dispassionate is the opposite of passionate, and while passions are said to run \"hot,\" dispassionate people are often described as \"cold.\" Many people think that a judge should be dispassionate when deciding a case \u014c\u0106\u00f6 unaffected by strong emotions or preconceived prejudices."}
