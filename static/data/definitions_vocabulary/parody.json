{"short": "A parody is a humorous or mocking imitation of something, using the same form as the original. To parody a poem, you have to write another poem.", "long": "A parody is a form of humor that spoofs \u2014 or satirizes \u2014 something using the same form. For example, shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Daily Show\" parody newscasts by doing fake newscasts that look like the real thing.
