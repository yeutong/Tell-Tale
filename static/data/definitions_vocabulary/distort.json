{"short": "Distort means to twist out of shape. When you look at a tree through a twisting kaleidoscope, you distort its image, making its branches and leaves look wavy and misshapen.", "long": "Distort is a verb that means to change the shape of something. You can distort pretzel dough by twisting it into the shape of an \"S\" instead of a normal pretzel shape. You can also distort, or change, the meaning of something. When one distorts the truth, it might not be an out-and-out lie; it could just be an exaggeration \u2014 like telling your pals you caught a six-foot tuna when you actually landed a six-inch minnow."}
