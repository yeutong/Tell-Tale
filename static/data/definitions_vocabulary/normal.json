{"short": "If something conforms to a general pattern, standard, or average, we describe it as normal, but of course that standard can change over time. What's normal today may be \"abnormal\" in the future.", "long": "The word normal comes from a Latin word normalis, which described something made with a carpenter's square. Something built this way would be normed to have angles that were perfectly aligned and fit a general pattern. This meaning eventually gave us the broader sense of fitting a pattern, standard, or average. Doctors like you to be a normal weight for your height, so you may need to grow taller to make your doctor happy."}
