{"short": "To donate means to give something \u2014 money, goods, or time \u2014 to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply \"giving\"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.", "long": "The verb donate has always meant \"to give,\" all the way back to the Latin verb don\u0101re, \"to give as a gift.\" Trace it back even further, to the ancient Indo-European roots, and you still have that same feeling to the word \u2014 \"a gift.\" But it's more than a gift \u2014 it's a gift with the intention of helping. As an African proverb says, \"If everybody in town donates one thread, the poor man has a shirt.\""}
