{"short": "If I had more than an exiguous amount of space here, I'd be able to tell you more about the fact that exiguous means a tiny amount.", "long": "Exiguous is one of those words that comes in handy when you're really trying to draw attention to the fact that there's very little of something. Otherwise you could just say \"tiny,\" \"small,\" \"niggling,\" or even \"scanty.\" Without more than the exiguous scraps of information currently available, there's simply no way to know who left the offending pile in the hallway, let alone when. If you expect more than just exiguous payment in return, you're going to have to do more than an exiguous amount of work."}
