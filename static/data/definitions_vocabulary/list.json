{"short": "To make a list is to put things in order or to name them, like a grocery list or a wish list. Listing is also leaning over, creating a slant called a list.", "long": "List can also be a verb used to describe what you do when you make a list. You could list all the state capitals, people's names, your favorite movies, or pretty much anything. Listing can be done numerically, alphabetically, or randomly. Also, a line or surface that leans or tilts has a list, like a sagging bookcase that's overloaded. To lean in this way is to list: the Leaning Tower of Pisa is listing."}
