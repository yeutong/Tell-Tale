{"short": "Posture is the way you position your body or arrange your limbs. So stand up straight, put your shoulders back, and lift that chin up.", "long": "Ballerinas have an elegant, graceful posture, and soldiers tend to display a rigid, strong posture. If you sit hunched over your desk every day you'll end up with terrible posture. This noun describes the way you carry yourself, but can also describe a certain body position you take, like the different postures in yoga. If you're accused of posturing though, that's a different story \u2014 that means you're behaving unnaturally to impress someone."}
