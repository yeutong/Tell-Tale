{"short": "If your friend is acting cool, unconcerned or in an indifferent manner, call him nonchalant \u0101\u0080\u0094 like when he saunters by a group of whispering, giggling girls and just nods and says, \"Hey.\"", "long": "If you act nonchalant, you are literally acting cool, as nonchalant traces back to non- \"not\" and Latin cal\u00c4\u0093re \"to be warm.\" Isn't that cool? Sometimes, a nonchalant person acts indifferent or uninterested, but really cares very much. If you give a girl a nonchalant smile, you definitely want her to notice you! Even though it begins with non, nonchalant has no positive form \u0101\u0080\u0094  chalant is not a word."}
