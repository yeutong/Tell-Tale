{"short": "A book that feels like it is several hundred pages longer than it needs to be is prolix. The word simply means that something has too many words and goes on too long.", "long": "To avoid being called prolix, we'll keep this short. Prolix means using more words than necessary. For a less formal word choice try wordy, verbose, long-winded or drawn out."}
