{"short": "When something is viable, it has the ability to grow or function properly. A viable seed can develop into a plant, while a viable company has the resources to succeed.", "long": "The adjective viable refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin root vita, which means \"life,\" and the ending -able, which means \"to be possible.\" In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable airplane after many tries and spectacular failures."}
