{"short": "Something that's old-fashioned and maybe a little out of place is anachronistic,  like  a clunky black rotary-dial telephone sitting on a desk beside a sleek new smart-phone (or whatever the new technology is when  you read this).", "long": "The adjective anachronistic comes from the Greek words ana, or \"against\", and khronos, or \"time.\" It usually refers to something old-fashioned or antique, but it can also mean anything that blatantly clashes with the time in which it is seen. Imagine watching a movie that takes place in the 1700s and seeing one of the characters pull out a cell phone. Any phone, in the context of the movie's time period, would be anachronistic."}
