{"short": "Straightforward and truthful talk might be described with the adjective candid.  If you're always candid, your parents will know that they can trust you.", "long": "A serious-minded politician might suggest engaging in a \"candid discussion\" about a complicated topic like health care or the environment, because candid means \"open\" or \"frank.\" Remember that TV show Candid Camera? It was called that because its hidden cameras supposedly showed a candid view of reality. In photography, candid has become a noun meaning \"an unposed photo.\" The word comes from Latin candidus, meaning \"white,\" which was later extended to mean \"pure.\" Candid talk provides the pure, unvarnished truth."}
