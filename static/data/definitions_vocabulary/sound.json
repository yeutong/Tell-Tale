A doorbell, a fire alarm, a cat's meow, or your brother's snoring \u014c\u0106\u00f6 they\u014c\u0106\u00d6re all sounds.", "long": "Long Island Sound is another kind of sound \u014c\u0106\u00f6 it\u014c\u0106\u00d6s a branch of the Atlantic Ocean that runs between Connecticut and Long Island, New York. When you don\u014c\u0106\u00d6t know a word, you might sound out the syllables \u014c\u0106\u00f6 say them aloud \u014c\u0106\u00f6 to figure out the pronunciation. Sound can also mean \"solid or good.\" Sound advice is good advice. Sound investments are secure.
