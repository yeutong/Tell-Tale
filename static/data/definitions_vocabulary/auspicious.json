{"short": "Use the adjective auspicious for a favorable situation or set of conditions. If you start a marathon by falling flat on your face, that's not an auspicious start.", "long": "If something seems likely to bring success \u2014 either because it creates favorable conditions or you just consider it a lucky sign \u2014 label it auspicious. The word is related to auspice, \"a divine omen,\" an old word with a colorful history. In Latin, an auspex was a person who observed the flight of birds to predict things about the future. Luckily, you no longer have to be a bird-watching fortune-teller to guess whether something is auspicious or not."}
