{"short": "You can't miss something that's pronounced, because it's totally obvious. If you sprain your ankle playing soccer, you might walk with a pronounced limp for a few days.", "long": "When things are pronounced, they're noticeable or conspicuous, like the pronounced lines in your grandfather's face or the pronounced Italian accent of your new neighbor who just arrived from Rome. The original meaning of this word was simply \"spoken,\" and you can also use it that way: for example, the word \"eve\" has one pronounced e and one silent e. But the \"emphatic or obvious\" meaning is far more common."}
