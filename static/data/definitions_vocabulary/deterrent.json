{"short": "A deterrent makes you not want to do something. Let's say there's a giant pile of cookies being guarded by an angry dog \u2014 the dog is a deterrent.", "long": "People talk about deterrents most often when discussing crime. The death penalty is supposed to be a deterrent \u2014 the idea is that people will be so scared of the death penalty that they won't commit certain crimes. Jail is another deterrent. Teachers also use deterrents \u2014 the possibility of getting detention is a deterrent that should encourage students to behave. A deterrent is the opposite of a reward. A reward encourages you to do the right thing, while a deterrent discourages you from doing the wrong thing."}
