{"short": "To brandish something is to wave it about aggressively, as one might brandish a sword or tennis racket (if it's a particularly intense game).", "long": "Brandish often implies that a person is wielding a physical weapon. In fact, brandish comes from the archaic French word brandir, meaning \u201csword.\u201d However, it\u2019s also possible to brandish objects that aren\u2019t weapons. If you win a bowling tournament, for example, you might be inclined to brandish your shiny new trophy in front of the other competitors. Be careful, though; they might mistake your trophy for a \"brandir\" and respond accordingly."}
