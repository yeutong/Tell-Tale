{"short": "A bristle is a stiff hair \u014c\u0106\u00f6 the kind men shave off their face or the kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and you'll get the idea.", "long": "The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs \u014c\u0106\u00f6 the ones that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying \"to get one's hackles up,\" which is pretty much identical to bristling."}
