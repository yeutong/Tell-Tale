{"short": "When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date, call it superfluous.", "long": "Superfluous (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means \"more than required.\" Use it when pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from the quality of something: \"For a climb over a glacier, the very thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems superfluous to me,\" wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The word comes from Latin and literally means \"overflowing\": super (\"over\") + fluere (\"to flow\"). So you can think of a superfluous addition as flowing over the boundaries of what's needed."}
