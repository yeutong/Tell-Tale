{"short": "A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow knighthood, it is a form of praise or an award.", "long": "In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to \"embrace the neck,\" which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, accolade came to mean \"award.\" A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy, an accolade of achievement, while a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does either of these types of accolade involve a sword."}
