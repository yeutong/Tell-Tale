{"short": "When we reassure other people, we pat them on the head, give them a hug, or say soothing words to convince them that everything is going to be OK.", "long": "When someone thinks they aren't smart enough, strong enough, or good enough for something, you reassure them to build their confidence up. Folks who worry a lot need to be reassured all the time, though they might not really believe your reassurances. People can also be reassured by things that happen too: an A on a paper could reassure a student that he's a good writer."}
