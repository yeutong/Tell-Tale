{"short": "When you remove or set apart one thing from others, you isolate it. You could isolate yourself  from people by living in a remote hut or, if you're a biologist, you could isolate a chromosome.", "long": "The verb isolate comes from the adjective isolated, which comes from the Latin insulatas, meaning \u201cmade into an island.\u201d You may have heard the John Donne quote, \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d Donne was claiming that no matter how much you might try to isolate yourself from the rest of humanity, in the end people are all connected to one another. Humanity\u2019s need for connectedness may, in fact, be illustrated by the fact that jailers frequently isolate criminals as punishment."}
