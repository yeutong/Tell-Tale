{"short": "If you are gullible, the joke is on you because you are easily fooled.", "long": "It is thought that gullible might be derived from the verb gull, meaning \"to swallow.\" This would be a funny coincidence as gullible describes an overly trusting person who tends to swallow the stories he hears whole. The related word, gull, can be used as a noun \"don't be such a gull!\" or as a verb \"you can't gull me into believing that!\""}
