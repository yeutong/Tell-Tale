{"short": "If you're irascible, you get angry easily \u2014 perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into you.", "long": "Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means \"anger\" or \"rage,\" the same root that gives us  the word ire, \"anger.\" The -sc in the middle of irascible, means \"becoming,\" so irascible doesn't just mean you're angry \u2014 it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of the time, then you're irascible \u2014 ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire."}
