If someone else is harming you, you are yourself suffering from abuse.", "long": "The word abuse is made up of two parts \u2014 \"use,\" which means to employ, and ab-, a Latin prefix meaning \"away\" \u2014 and as a whole comes from the Latin ab\u016bsus, meaning \"misuse,\" or \"use wrongly.\" It began as a verb and became a noun in the mid-15th century. Abuse also refers to anything that is employed improperly or to excess, such as the abuse of alcohol or drugs."}
