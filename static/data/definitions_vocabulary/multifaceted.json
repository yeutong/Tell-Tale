Diamonds are usually cut to be multifaceted, that is, with many angled flat surfaces, because this increases their ability to reflect light.", "long": "Since facet means \"aspect,\" \"side,\" or \"face,\" multifaceted means \"many aspects, sides, or faces.\" This can apply to jewels or other physical objects, like the eyes of a dragonfly, but it can also refer to complicated issues that have lots of contributing factors and generate more than two sides to an argument. A multifaceted person has many abilities, or a personality with many sides to it."}
