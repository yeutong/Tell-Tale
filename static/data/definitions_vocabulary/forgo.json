{"short": "The verb forgo means to give up or lose the right to something.", "long": "The word forgo can be traced back to the Old English word forg\u0101n, which meant to pass away or to die, which is sometimes referred to as \"giving up the ghost.\" Perhaps it was this idea of relinquishing something that led to our modern-day use of the word forgo to mean to give up, waive, or forfeit something. For example, someone charged with a crime might decide to forgo the right to remain silent and instead confess."}
