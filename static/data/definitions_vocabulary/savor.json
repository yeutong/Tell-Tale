{"short": "Whether it\u2019s a feeling of joy or a piece of pecan pie \u2014 when you savor something, you enjoy it to the fullest.", "long": "When you savor something, you enjoy it so much that you want to make it last forever. With that in mind, savor carries a connotation of doing something slowly. If you savor that flourless chocolate tart, then you eat it slowly, bit by bit, deliberately picking every last crumb off the plate. The word is often applied to eating, but you can savor any pleasurable experience, whether it\u2019s the winning touchdown or your moment in the spotlight."}
