{"short": "If you rudely behave as if you have a right to something that you have no right to, you're committing effrontery. When a couple stroll into a crowded restaurant, demand the best table, and threaten the staff unless they're seated right away, that's effrontery.", "long": "People have been guilty of outrageously self-centered behavior at least since 1715, when effrontery was coined. Tracing to the French word effront\u00e9, meaning \"shameless,\" the word effrontery is also connected to brazen, which means \"of brass,\" and describes someone so accustomed to effrontery that he's hardened to it and has no concern for the harm done to others."}
