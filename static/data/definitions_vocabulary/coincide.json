{"short": "When things happen at the same time, they are said to coincide. Often, this is because they're intentionally coordinated \u2014 \"the bake sale coincided with Parent Day\" \u2014 but not always.", "long": "Coincide can also mean happen together in other ways. \"My mother's views on appropriate teen fashion do not always coincide with mine\" is a tactful way to say she hates your clothes. You could also describe two roads coming together as coinciding \u2014 though it's more poetic to talk about when they diverge."}
