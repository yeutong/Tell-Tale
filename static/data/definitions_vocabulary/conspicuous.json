{"short": "Keep your eye on the adjective conspicuous for something that stands out so much you notice it right away \u2014 like that zit in the center of your friend's forehead.", "long": "Conspicuous comes from the adjectival form of the Latin verb, conspicere, meaning \"to look at.\" Conspicuous can mean either very obvious to the eye (like something that is conspicuous from a distance) or attracting attention (like conspicuous consumption). If you are doing something wrong, it's wise not to be conspicuous about it!"}
