{"short": "Pernicious means harmful and subtle, such as a poison gas that causes illness in those exposed to it over the course of years.", "long": "Pernicious comes from the Latin perniciosus, \"destructive,\" which in turn comes from pernicies, \"death\" or \"ruin.\" You might have heard your parents and teachers talk about the pernicious effects of watching too much TV and playing video games all day \u2014 they'll turn your brain to mush (allegedly)."}
