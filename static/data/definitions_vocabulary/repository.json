{"short": "Think of a repository as a storehouse, a place where things are kept until needed. A silo is a repository for animal feed, and a trivia buff's mind is a repository for useless information.", "long": "The noun repository has a somewhat formal ring to it \u2014 why not just call a storehouse a storehouse, right? Think of a repository as somewhat more important and imposing than just a place to dump stuff. It has more of an air of authority, like the things stored there could change the world. Consider nuclear waste \u2014 would you rather store it in a dump or a repository? I don\u2019t know about you, but I'd prefer the latter\u2014sounds safer."}
