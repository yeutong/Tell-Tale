{"short": "Here's a mind-bender: \"This statement is false.\" If you think it's true, then it must be false, but if you think it's false, it must be true. Now that's a paradox!", "long": "A paradox is a logical puzzler that contradicts itself in a baffling way. \"This statement is false\" is a classic example, known to logicians as \"the liar's paradox.\" Paradoxical statements may seem completely self-contradictory, but they can be used to reveal deeper truths. When Oscar Wilde said, \"I can resist anything except temptation,\" he used a paradox to highlight how easily we give in to tempting things while imagining that we can hold firm and resist them."}
