{"short": "Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.", "long": "Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually touching and yet they are also defined as \"touching, sharing a border.\" You can use this adjective to describe people or things related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, \"bordering upon.\" Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of what's called \"semantic ambiguity,\" when something can mean more than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise."}
