{"short": "Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to alleviate, or relieve, your pain.", "long": "The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis \"light\" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate \u2014 both words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger."}
