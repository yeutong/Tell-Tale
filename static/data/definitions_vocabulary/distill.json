{"short": "When you distill something, you are boiling it down to its essence \u0101\u0080\u0094 its most important part. Whether it's alcohol or ideas, the distilled part is the most powerful.", "long": "The original meaning of distill comes from the process of making alcohol, known as distilling, in which all the impurities of a substance are vaporized and its pure, high-alcohol condensation collected. Distill eventually came to mean any process in which the essence of something is revealed. If you take notes at a lecture and then turn them into an essay for your professor, you're distilling your notes into something more pure and exact. At least, that's what you hope you're doing."}
