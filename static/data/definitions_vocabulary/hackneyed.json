{"short": "Hackneyed is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. \"Roses are red, violets are...\" \u0101\u0080\u0094 enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff.", "long": "Hackneyed is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see hackneyed before the word phrase to refer to a specific clich\u0106\u00a9 that is annoying the heck out of someone."}
