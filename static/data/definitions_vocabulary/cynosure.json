{"short": "A cynosure is the main attraction. A figure skater on the ice is the cynosure, or focal point, of a stadium as she triple-axels through the air. All eyes are on her with admiration, hoping that she'll land it.", "long": "Cynosure, pronounced sy-na-shoor, comes from the Greek word kynosoura, or \"dog's tail.\" In Latin Cynosura refers to the constellation Ursa Minor, also known as the North Star. Unlike other stars, the North Star is a fixed point, used by sailors to orient themselves for centuries. Like a bride who attracts the attention of everyone at a wedding as she comes down the aisle, the North Star is the cynosure for travelers lost in the forest without a map."}
