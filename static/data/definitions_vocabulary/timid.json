{"short": "Timid means \"overly cautious or fearful,\" like a timid driver who drives very slowly or avoids highways altogether.", "long": "Timid comes from the Middle French word timide, meaning \"easily frightened, shy.\" Those who are timid often worry that things will go wrong: a timid eater orders bland food to avoid the possibility not liking the flavor of something new, just as a timid partygoer talks to people he already knows, afraid that he won't be able to talk to strangers."}
