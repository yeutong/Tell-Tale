{"short": "To retaliate means to get back at someone, usually through a counterattack. \u201cNed got hit with a cream pie, then he retaliated by throwing a bucket of Jell-O at his attackers.\u201d", "long": "When you see the prefix re in a word, it usually means back. To return, remember, regurgitate (yuck) \u2014 all of these verbs relate to doing something back. At the beginning of retaliate it means back, and the taliate means to pay, so what you\u2019re talking about here is payback. If you\u2019re doing something terrible to someone just because you want to, that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean to retaliate. But, if you feel they\u2019ve done something bad to you, and you\u2019re just getting them back? That\u2019s when you retaliate."}
