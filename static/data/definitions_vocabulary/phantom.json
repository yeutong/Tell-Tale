{"short": "Look over there, across the room.  Is that a phantom, some weary soul come back from the dead to haunt you?  Maybe it\u2019s a shadow, or maybe it\u2019s a ghost.  Either way, turn on a light and it\u2019ll disappear.  Hopefully.", "long": "Sleeping is difficult if there\u2019s a phantom in your room, because who can rest with ghosts around?  Some phantoms are real, but phantom can also be used to mean \"a trick of the mind,\" like hearing a person outside your window, but then realizing it\u2019s only the phantom rustling of leaves in a tree.  Phantom limb is when someone loses an arm or leg, but their brain can still feel where their limb used to be."}
