{"short": "A cavalry is a group of soldiers who fight on horses. Cavalry can also refer to any military unit that is quick and mobile.", "long": "If a general said, \"Send in the cavalry!\" you can be sure a group of soldiers are being called upon. The only question is whether the cavalry is the traditional sort or if the word is being used more loosely. Traditionally, a cavalry is a unit of troops on horseback. When horses were a primary means of transportation, cavalries were a common part of war. Since then, a cavalry might be any unit of soldiers that can be quickly deployed."}
