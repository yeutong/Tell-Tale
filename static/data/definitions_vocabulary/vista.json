{"short": "A vista is a scene, view, or panorama. It's what you stop to see when you climb to the top of a mountain, or pull off the road at the \"scenic view\" rest stop.", "long": "Vista is an Italian word that means \"sight\" or \"view.\" It's the same in Spanish and is related to the verb avistar, which means \"to catch sight of.\" Hasta la vista! means, literally, \"Until I see you!\" (or, more simply, \"See you later!\"). As in Spain and Mexico, we like to name our towns after a vista: Buena Vista (\"great scenery\"), Chula Vista (\"pleasant view\"), and Rio Vista (\"overlooking the river\") are all places in California."}
