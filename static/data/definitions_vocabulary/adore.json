{"short": "Someone you adore gets put on a pedestal. Considering your fear of germs, when you told me that you had shared a toothbrush \u2014 I knew you must adore her!", "long": "Adore comes from the Latin word adorare, meaning \u201cto worship.\u201d  So when you adore someone, it's more than just a crush. However, like many words of strong emotion, adore gets used in lighter situations as well. Your aunt tells me you just adore the miniature fruitcakes she sends you every holiday."}
