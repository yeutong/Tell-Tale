{"short": "When we talk about \"primitive man\", we're usually talking about cavemen and other people who existed before the advent of table manners, but if your uncle speaks grunts and chews with his mouth open, you could describe him as primitive too.", "long": "Primitive is related to the word prime, and the root of both words is primus, which is Latin for \"first.\" Since the phrase \"primitive man\" refers to the world's first people, you might think that the word primate has something to do with the similarity between early humans and monkeys, but it doesn't.  Monkey, apes, and humans are called primates because they're seen as standing on the first, or highest, rung of the animal-kingdom ladder."}
