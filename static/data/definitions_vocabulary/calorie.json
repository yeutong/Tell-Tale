{"short": "A calorie is the energy that it takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree centigrade. More importantly, a calorie is a unit that you can use to measure the energy in your food.", "long": "From the Latin calor, \u201cto heat,\u201d a calorie is a measurement of heat energy (it may be called a small calorie or a large calorie). When you\u2019re out of the chemistry lab, you\u2019ll most often hear calorie in relation to the energy in food or the energy you burn through exercise. It will also usually be referred to in the plural, as calories. This makes sense: just one calorie won\u2019t make any difference in what you weigh, but many calories will!"}
