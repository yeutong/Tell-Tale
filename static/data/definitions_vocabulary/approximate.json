{"short": "To approximate is to calculate the value of something based on informed knowledge. A computer program can approximate the value of a house based on square footage, number of rooms, year built, and other relevant factors.", "long": "As a verb, approximate means \"to estimate.\" Unlike the word guess, approximate implies the use of a logical or mathematical method. You might guess how tall a friend is based on the first number that comes to mind, but you could approximate his height by using your own height as a comparison. As an adjective, approximate can mean \"near\" or \"close together.\" If your friend calls to say he\u2019s at a location approximate to your house, she\u2019s in your neighborhood."}
