{"short": "An oration is a formal speech given in public. You might give the oration at the big party celebrating your grandparents\u2019 50th anniversary.", "long": "If you\u2019re giving an oration, make sure you show up prepared. An oration is a speech that\u2019s planned in advance rather than made up on the spot. It usually has a formal tone and is presented at a ceremony of some kind. You probably remember nervously sitting through an oration at your graduation ceremony, or you may have listened to a funeral oration celebrating the life of a famous person."}
