{"short": "Laudatory has to do with praise. If you do great things, then you've done praise-worthy acts and people will use laudatory words when talking about you.", "long": "We all probably do something laudable at some point. If you play baseball well or just keep your room clean, then you probably receive laudatory words of encouragement. If I say, \"Your dog is the cutest, nicest pooch in North America,\" I am saying laudatory things about your dog. When you see laudatory, think praise."}
