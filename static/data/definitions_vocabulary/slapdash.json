The paint job was slapdash: it looked like they did it in an hour, without brushes.", "long": "The meaning of the word slapdash is clear from its two parts, slap and dash. If you make something in a slapdash way, you slap it together and then dash away \u2014 probably so no one would notice.

But in the long run, you'll lose much more time redoing your shoddy work."}
