{"short": "A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off \u2014 all of these could be described as evanescent, which means \u201cfleeting\u201d or \u201ctemporary.\u201d", "long": "Evanescent comes from the Latin ex, meaning \"out of,\" and vanescere, meaning \"to vanish.\" When pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note that the c is silent. You might want to practice saying evanescent a few times right now; if you stumble over pronunciation when you need this word the most, whatever you\u2019re describing \u2014 be it a shooting star or a whiff of fragrant perfume \u2014 will be gone."}
