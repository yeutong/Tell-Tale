{"short": "The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons.", "long": "When we talk about being on the \"straight and narrow path\" we aim to live a truthful and moral life. The Latin root of erroneous, or \"to be incorrect\" as well as \"to be immoral,\" is errare, which means \"to wander.\" It's clear that we make connections between behavior and direction or space. These two ideas have been linked for a very long time!"}
