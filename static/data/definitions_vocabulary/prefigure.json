{"short": "Something that is a sign of things to come can be said to prefigure the future thing \u2014 and usually not in a good way.", "long": "Sleeping through your alarm Monday morning might prefigure your entire week \u2014 in other words, it might be a sign of the unlucky days ahead.English is rich in terms that have the basic meaning of \"tell something about the future.\" Perhaps because we all wish we knew more about it! The Latin root of prefigure is praefigurare, from prae, \"before,\" and figurare , \"to form or shape.\""}
