{"short": "An indigent person is extremely poor, lacking the basic resources of a normal life. Often the indigent lack not only money but homes.", "long": "Indigent comes from a Latin word meaning wanting, which we used to use to mean \u201clacking\u201d and not just to describe desires. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens, free medical clinics and court-appointed lawyers are all institutions that our society has developed to help indigent people."}
