{"short": "An impudent person is bold, sassy, and shameless. If your teacher asks the class to open their textbooks, and you snap back, \"Let's not and say we did,\" you're being impudent.", "long": "Impudent comes from the Latin combination of im, meaning without, and pudens, meaning shame. We often call someone impudent if they\u2019re disrespectful, snotty, or inappropriate in a way that makes someone feel bad. If you know someone has just lost all their money on the stock market, don\u2019t be impudent and ask them how they\u2019re going to afford gas money for their yacht."}
