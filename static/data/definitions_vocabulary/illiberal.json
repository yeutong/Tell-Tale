{"short": "Someone who's illiberal is close-minded and intolerant. Your illiberal grandfather might constantly complain about \"kids today with their long hair and tattoos.\"", "long": "An illiberal person tends to have old-fashioned values and opinions and isn't usually interested in considering other perspectives. It's illiberal to dismiss unfamiliar religious beliefs \u2014 or the lack of any religious belief \u2014 as just plain wrong. The original, 1500s meaning of illiberal was \"ungentlemanly,\" from the Latin word illiberalis, \"ungenerous, mean, or unworthy of a freeman.\" The \"narrow-minded\" sense of the word is from the mid-1600s."}
