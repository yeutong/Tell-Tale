{"short": "When something is really big and holds a lot it is capacious, like a capacious purse that is so big, people mistake it for a piece of luggage.", "long": "Have you ever seen a Fourth of July hot dog eating contest? As you watch people wolf down 60 or more hot dogs in a matter of minutes, you must be thinking, \"Where do they put all that food?\" Well, it helps to have a capacious stomach. The suffix -ous adds \"full of\" to capacity; capacious is literally \"full of capacity.\"  If something is capacious, it has plenty of extra room."}
