{"short": "A protagonist is the central character in a story: the protagonist of Huckleberry Finn is \u014c\u0106\u00f6 guess who? \u014c\u0106\u00f6 Huckleberry Finn.", "long": "A novel, movie, or play might have many main characters, but it can really only have one protagonist \u014c\u0106\u00f6 or maybe two in the case of, say, Romeo and Juliet. That's because protos means \"first\" in Greek, and agonistes means \"competitor\" or \"actor.\" It can also mean a leading figure in a real-life situation: \"Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were the protagonists of the U.S. Civil War.\" Don't use it to mean \"a supporter of an idea or cause\"; the word you're looking for in that situation is proponent."}
