{"short": "Something that is moribund is almost dead, like a moribund economy that has been stuck in a recession for years.", "long": "In Latin, mori means \"to die.\" You probably recognize this root in words like mortal, mortician, and mortuary. Moribund means \"near death,\" but it can also mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over the Internet becomes a more and more popular way to watch movies and television shows, the DVD has become a moribund medium."}
