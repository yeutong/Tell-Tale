{"short": "To augur is to predict or indicate. A black cat passing in front of you is said to augur bad luck, but if you love cats you can choose to believe that it augurs good luck instead.", "long": "In the past, when you said you would augur the future it meant you would predict it. That form of augur is rarely used today, but the sense of prediction \u2014 connected to an object or event \u2014 remains. Dark clouds augur a rainstorm. If you skip a dress rehearsal before opening night of a show, it won\u2019t augur well for your performance. The Latin root stems from an ancient Roman religious official who predicted the future from omens."}
