{"short": "Soak your tooth in a cup of soda for long enough and it will disintegrate, or break apart from decay.", "long": "The word disintegrate comes from a combination of the prefix dis- meaning \"do the opposite of\" and the Latin integrare meaning \"to make whole.\" When something disintegrates, it does the opposite of become whole; it falls apart. Objects can either disintegrate over time \u2014 like a tooth soaking in a cup of soda, or instantaneously \u2014 like a building disintegrating into dust from an explosion."}
