{"short": "You can use the verb suspend any time you need to stop something. Whether it\u0101\u0080\u0099s your judgment, a rule, or bus service, when you suspend it, you temporarily bring it to a halt.", "long": "Suspend often describes stopping an activity for a while. A winter storm, for example, may suspend air travel until weather conditions improve. Suspend also works in a more figurative sense, such as when you suspend your doubt in order to give someone or something a fair chance. A student who is suspended is temporarily forbidden from attending class. Don't confuse this with expel, which means he or she may never return."}
