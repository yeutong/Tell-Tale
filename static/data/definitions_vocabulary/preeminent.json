{"short": "Calling someone preeminent means they're truly outstanding or better than everyone else \u0101\u0080\u0094 not in general, but in a specific field or specialty. Many people consider primatologist Jane Goodall to be the preeminent expert on chimpanzees.", "long": "The adjective preeminent was first recorded in the mid-15th century and has its roots in the Latin praeeminentem, which means \u0101\u0080\u009cto project forward, rise above.\u0101\u0080\u009d And anything that's been described as preeminent certainly does rise above the rest. Preeminent scholars or universities or craftsmen are the best at what they do and are well known because of it."}
