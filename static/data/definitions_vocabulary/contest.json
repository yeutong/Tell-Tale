{"short": "A contest is a struggle to determine who's tops \u014c\u0106\u014d- you might wrestle an alligator in a contest of brute strength versus strategy. You can also enter a contest \u014c\u0106\u00f6 a yodeling contest or a cake-decorating contest, depending on your talents.", "long": "If you're being sued and you respond to the court order saying \"no contest,\" you're saying you're not going to put up a fight. When you put the accent on the second syllable, contest becomes a verb, and it means to dispute something. You lost the election for class president, but you think there was something fishy going on at the ballot box, so you contest the results and ask for a recount."}
