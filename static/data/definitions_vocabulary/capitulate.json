{"short": "To capitulate means to give in to something. If your parents refuse to raise your allowance, you might try to argue until they capitulate. Good luck!", "long": "To capitulate is to surrender outright or to give in under certain terms. Either way, you\u2019re agreeing to something you don\u2019t really want. The word comes from the Latin roots caput (\"head\") and capitulum (\"headings\"), a reference to the official agreement drawn up when someone formally surrendered."}
