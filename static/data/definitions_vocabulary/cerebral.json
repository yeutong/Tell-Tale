{"short": "If you are a cerebral person, no one would ever call you a drama queen. You make decisions using your intelligence and cold, hard facts, instead of your emotions.", "long": "The word cerebral gets its meaning from cerebrum, which is Latin for \"brain.\" Cerebral people use their brains instead of their hearts. The cerebrum is a particular section of the brain, and anything related to that part is also cerebral, like in medicine. A cerebral hemorrhage, for example, means a hemorrhage has occurred in the brain \u2014 a phrase you'd never want to hear coming from a doctor."}
