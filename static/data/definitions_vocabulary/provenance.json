{"short": "Where something comes from is its provenance. If a style of music originated in the capital of Rhode Island, you could say that its provenance was Providence.", "long": "Some items of foreign provenance are taxed more heavily than domestic products. If you claim that an artwork put up for sale was stolen from your family's art collection, an investigation may be ordered to resolve issues of provenance. In this case, provenance refers to who has the legal right to the specific work of art, or to whom it belongs."}
