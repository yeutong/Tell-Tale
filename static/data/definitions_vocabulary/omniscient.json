{"short": "To be omniscient is to know everything. This often refers to a special power of God.", "long": "If you combine the Latin roots omnis (meaning \"all\") and scientia (meaning \"knowledge\"), you'll get omniscient, meaning \"knowledge of all.\" It would be nice to be omniscient: then you would know absolutely everything in the world. Many religions have a god who is all-powerful and omniscient. This is how a god is supposed to know when you sinned, or what's going to happen in the future."}
