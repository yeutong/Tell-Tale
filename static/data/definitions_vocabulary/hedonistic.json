{"short": "A hedonistic person is committed to seeking sensual pleasure \u0101\u0080\u0094 the type of guy you might find in a massage parlor or at an all-you-can-eat buffet.", "long": "This term \u0101\u0080\u0094 along with the related words hedonist and hedonistic \u0101\u0080\u0094 is derived from the Greek word hedone, \"pleasure.\" The Cyreniacs taught that physical gratification is superior to the mental satisfaction offered by anticipation and remembrance. That's why hedonistic folks revel in pleasure, and demand it in the present tense."}
