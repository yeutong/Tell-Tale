{"short": "To debase something is to make it corrupt or impure. If your lemonade stand sells \u201cpure lemonade,\u201d you\u2019d insist on using real lemons instead of a mix; using a mix would debase your product.", "long": "Debase is often used in the context of two things: coins and people. To debase a coin is to replace some of the precious metal in the coin with metal of lesser value. To debase a person is to corrupt them, often by driving them to perform an immoral act like (gasp!) using the lemonade mix. Just promise us you won\u2019t do it."}
