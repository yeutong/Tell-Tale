{"short": "A chimera is something you\u014c\u0106\u00d6ve imagined that\u014c\u0106\u00d6s bits and pieces of other things mashed together into a new horrible fantasy, something impossible in real life that only exists in your mind.", "long": "In Greek mythology, a chimera is a monster that has a lion\u014c\u0106\u00d6s head, a goat\u014c\u0106\u00d6s body, and a serpent\u014c\u0106\u00d6s tail.  And it breathes fire. No creature like that has ever existed, but the idea seemed real and terrifying to Greeks, and that\u014c\u0106\u00d6s another meaning: an idea that feels real but is impossible, like the idea of a world without evil.  Pronouncing the word is very possible though; just try it one of two ways: either kye-MEER-uh or kih-MEER-uh. Both work."}
