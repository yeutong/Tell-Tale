{"short": "When you forbear, you hold yourself back from doing something. If you're mad at your best friend, you might forbear to return her text messages for a while.", "long": "If you forbear to giggle during your teacher's stern lecture, that's a good thing. You keep yourself from laughing out loud, even though that's instinctively what you want to do. The Old English root, forberan, means \"control one's feelings, or tolerate.\" A less common way to use forbear is as a noun meaning \"ancestor.\" So  if you're refraining from reading about your ancestors, you can say you forbear to learn about your forbears."}
