{"short": "Peremptory comments are like orders. If you say something in a peremptory manner, you want people to stop what they\u014c\u0106\u00d6re doing and do what you say. Peremptory comments put an end to a discussion, and that\u014c\u0106\u00d6s final!", "long": "The word peremptory comes from the Latin peremptorius for \u014c\u0106\u00a3decisive, final.\u014c\u0106\u00d8 Trace it further and find that peremptor  means \"destroyer,\" from perimpere for \"destroy, cut off.\u014c\u0106\u00d8 Basically, peremptory commands destroy the conversation. They are given with an air of authority, and they are often barked. In the courtroom, peremptory orders are not open to appeal; they\u014c\u0106\u00d6re final. Outside of the courtroom, a peremptory manner is just plain rude."}
