{"short": "Inchoate means just beginning to form. You can have an inchoate idea, like the earliest flickers of images for your masterpiece, or an inchoate feeling, like your inchoate sense of annoyance toward your sister's new talking parrot.", "long": "Inchoate comes from a Latin word for beginning. When something is inchoate, although you don\u2019t yet understand what it is fully, you have a strong sense that it is indeed coming. It\u2019s stronger than the wisp of an idea that never turns into anything. But it\u2019s hard to really find the language to describe an inchoate idea. That\u2019s the whole point: you don\u2019t have the words for it yet!"}
