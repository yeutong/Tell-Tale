{"short": "Have you ever heard the phrase \"fake it until you make it\"? That is advice that encourages you to be meretricious, pretending to be something you aren't, like the meretricious flaunting of gigantic fake diamond earrings, pretending they are real \u2014 and that you can afford them.", "long": "To correctly pronounce meretricious, accent the third syllable: \"mer-uh-TRISH-us.\" Don't mistake something that is meretricious for having merit. In fact, it is just the opposite. From an expensive restaurant that looks expensively furnished but when the lights are turned up, you can see that \"leather\" chairs are just cheap vinyl or a woman who pretends her counterfeit handbags are designer originals, meretricious actions are meant to deceive."}
