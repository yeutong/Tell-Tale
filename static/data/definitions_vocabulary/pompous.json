He'll walk into a party with an inflated ego, ready to tell anyone who will listen that \"I'm kind of a big deal.\"", "long": "Today we associate the adjective pompous with self-important jerks. But it's actually derived from the Old French pompeux, which meant \u201cstately.\" And that's why you can also use pompous to describe something with a lot of ceremonial or stately display \u2014 in other words, something surrounded by \"pomp and circumstance.\""}
