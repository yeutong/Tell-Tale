If you disagree with how that play is being produced, you may want to open up a dialogue with the director.", "long": "Dialogue can refer to spoken lines in a dramatic performance such as a play, a film, or a television show. It is also any conversation between two or more people. On the written page, dialogue between characters is usually enclosed by quotation marks.
