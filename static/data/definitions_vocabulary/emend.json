{"short": "When you emend a piece of writing, you correct or revise it. If you are asked to emend a report, that just means you need to go through it and make revisions.", "long": "Emend is similar in spelling and pronunciation to another word, amend, and there\u2019s a slight overlap in meaning as well. Emend refers to changes and improvements made to a text. Amend also can refer to making minor changes to a text, but it can be used to describe improvements made to other things as well \u2014 for example, you can amend a situation. In contrast, emend\u2019s powers are limited to words. So if you\u2019re using emend \u2014 the one with the \"e\" \u2014 just make sure you\u2019re describing improvements that involve text."}
