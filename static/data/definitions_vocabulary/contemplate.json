{"short": "Before you accept a job offer, or a college's offer of admission, you should take time to contemplate the pros and cons of your decision. If you contemplate something, you think about it carefully.", "long": "Contemplate is from Latin contemplatus, past participle of contemplari \"to gaze attentively, observe,\" from the prefix com- \"together\" plus templum \"temple.\" The original meaning of Latin contemplari was \"to mark out a space for observing auguries or omens,\" and the temple was a holy space reserved for this purpose."}
