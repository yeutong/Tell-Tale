{"short": "Fleeting is an adjective that describes something that happens really fast, or something that doesn\u2019t last as long as you\u2019d like.", "long": "Driving in a car on the highway, you see a unicorn in the woods, but you only get a fleeting glimpse of it because you\u2019re driving too fast.  Bummer.  Fleeting comes from the Old English word fl\u0113otan, which means \u201cfloat, swim.\u201d  Like a ghost ship floating by on a foggy night, fleeting things disappear as fast as they appear.  Fleeting love may last more than a moment, but it won\u2019t stay for very long, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s called fleeting."}
