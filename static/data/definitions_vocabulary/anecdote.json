{"short": "A short, amusing true story is an anecdote. You might come back from a crazy spring break with a lot of anecdotes to tell.", "long": "The roots of anecdote lie in the Greek word anekdota, meaning \"unpublished.\" The word's original sense in English was \"secret or private stories\" \u2014 tales not fit for print, so to speak. It can still have connotations of unreliability, as in the phrase \"anecdotal information.\" But the most common sense today is that of \"a funny story about something that happened.\""}
