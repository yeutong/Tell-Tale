{"short": "Something that is iniquitous is extremely immoral or wicked, such as an iniquitous political regime that assassinates its enemies.", "long": "Use the adjective iniquitous to describe something that is truly bad, morally wrong, extremely wicked, or completely unfair. It\u2019s a strong word \u2014 don't use it lightly. If you go see a movie that\u2019s boring and too long, for example, it\u2019s just a bad movie. But a movie that encourages people to take violent action against a minority group? That's iniquitous because the movie's message is grossly immoral."}
