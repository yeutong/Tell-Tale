{"short": "Our time on earth is limited, or temporal.", "long": "Temporal comes from the Latin word temporalis which means \"of time\" and is usually applied to words that mean not having much of it, such as the temp who works at an office for a set amount of time, because temporary situations don't last long. A less common word, temporality also means \"having limited time,\" and it rhymes with mortality! (Don't remind us.) Temporal implies \"of this earth,\" too \u2014 temporal boundaries keep us from being able to fly around the clouds, but spiritual beings can zing around at will. Temporal can also refer to temples, the ones on the side of your head that are probably aching by now."}
