{"short": "To reiterate something is to say or do something again, or many times. Let me reiterate: if you repeat yourself, you're reiterating the thing you originally said.", "long": "This verb is from Middle English reiteraten, from Latin reiteratus, from reiterare \"to repeat,\" from the prefix re- \"again\" plus iterare \"to repeat, iterate.\" The English word iterate has the same meaning as reiterate, although it is not as commonly used."}
