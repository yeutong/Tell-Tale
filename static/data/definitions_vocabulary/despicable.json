{"short": "Stealing the last piece of food from a starving child goes way beyond mean. It's despicable \u0101\u0080\u0094 a vile and harmful act.", "long": "Mean, nasty, and scummy are synonyms of despicable, but they don't fully convey the awfulness of despicable. A man who lies to get a promotion meant for his co-worker would be considered mean. But the despicable man \u0101\u0080\u0094 the one who is so awful and worthless that he deserves to be despised \u0101\u0080\u0094 is the one who burns down the office building and frames his co-worker for it."}
