{"short": "You might not want to call a mercenary a \"hireling\" to his face, but a mercenary is, after all, a soldier who gets paid to fight where needed, sometimes taking a heroic stand and other times just wanting payment for fighting.", "long": "The word mercenary comes from the Latin merc\u0113n\u0101rius, \"hireling,\" which defines someone who will do anything in exchange for money. In history, a mercenary was often a fighter who followed the next paycheck, but in recent decades it's also been used for fighters who pursue a good cause in areas where soldiers are in short supply. A synonym for mercenary is \"soldier of fortune,\" and this phrase sometimes glorifies the mercenary, turning the meaning of \"fortune\" from \"cash\" to \"luck in battle.\""}
