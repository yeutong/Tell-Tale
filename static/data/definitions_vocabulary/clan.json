{"short": "A clan is an extended family. Your clan might include your parents and siblings, but also your cousins and second cousins, aunts and uncles, and grandparents.", "long": "Families that are related to each other, whether through marriage or as distant cousins, are members of the same clan. If you get together with a big family group every summer, you can say you vacation with your clan. In Scotland, a person's clan has a specific name, like \"clan MacLachlan.\" The word comes from the Gaelic clann, \"family\" or \"offspring,\" with the Latin root planta, \"offshoot.\""}
