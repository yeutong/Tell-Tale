{"short": "Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a common point: \u201cThousands of Elvis fans plan to converge on the small Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased superstar eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.\u201d", "long": "Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans \u2014 when things come together from different points they converge. Converge traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning \u201cto bend or to turn.\" The prefix con- means \"with,\" a good way to remember that things that converge come together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the opposite: \"move away,\" because the prefix \u201cdis-\u201d means \u201capart.\u201d"}
