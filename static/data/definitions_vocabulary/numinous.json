{"short": "Something numinous has a strong religious quality, suggesting the presence of a divine power. When you enter a temple, church, or mosque, you might feel as though you've entered a numinous space.", "long": "Numinous comes from the Latin numin- meaning \"divine power.\"  This word also comes from numen, a word used to describe the spirit or divine power characteristic of a thing or place. However, you don't have to be in a strictly religious environment to experience something numinous; you might see the beauty of a painting or the melody of a song as numinous \u2014 if they communicate a spiritual vibe."}
