{"short": "You could describe a particularly pretty scene as picturesque. But save it up for a view that's so gorgeous you'd love to have it framed on the wall as a painting.", "long": "Picturesque is an adjective used to describe something with strikingly pleasing or vivid qualities \u2014 a scene so picture-perfect that you feel an impulse to reach for your camera or double check to make sure it's real. A view of the pristine shoreline on a summer\u2019s day, a grandfather and grandson reading a book together, or a charming old farm cottage could all be called picturesque."}
