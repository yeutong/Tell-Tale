{"short": "\"I proclaim the Olympic Games open.\" Every two years with words similar to these, the Olympic games officially begin. To proclaim is to exclaim or declare.", "long": "When you proclaim something, you are saying it loud and clear and in public. A doctor can proclaim you healthy after you have recovered from a long illness. The panel of judges may have trouble proclaiming the winner in a very tight race. What you are saying out loud can be called a proclamation. Proclamations were once only made by Kings or other ruling leaders which is why the word proclaim has an official feeling to it."}
