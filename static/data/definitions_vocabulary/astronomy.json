{"short": "Astronomy is the science that looks up: at stars, at other planets, at solar systems, at galaxies, and at everything else in the universe.", "long": "The Ancient Greeks used the word astron for \"star,\" so it only makes sense that astronomy would involve the study or the stars (and other unearthly topics). Someone who studies or works in astronomy is an astronomer, and one of the main tools of the trade is the telescope. As telescopes get more and more powerful, astronomers learn more and more about what's going on out there, such as how old a star or planet is. If you ever wondered what's out there besides the Earth, you should learn more about astronomy."}
