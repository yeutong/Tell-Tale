{"short": "A flourish is an extra touch \u0101\u0080\u0094 a trumpet's \"ta-ta-da!\" announcing a king's entrance, a fancy carving atop an otherwise utilitarian pillar, a wave of a flag or a cheerleader's pompom.", "long": "Flourish can also mean \"growth\": \"With the right teacher, a child will flourish.\" To understand how the two meanings of flourish connect, remember that the word \"flower\" (spelled flour-) is hiding inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting out your name, flourishing her pom-poms."}
