{"short": "Clairvoyance is a magical kind of intuition. You could attempt to prove your clairvoyance by predicting which team will win the Superbowl.", "long": "Have you ever heard of the \"sixth sense,\" the mysterious ability to know something that can't be observed? That's clairvoyance. The ability to tell the future, read someone's mind, or communicate with dead people could all be described as clairvoyance. The French prefix clair, or \"clear,\" combined with voir, \"to see,\" gave us the word clairvoyance."}
