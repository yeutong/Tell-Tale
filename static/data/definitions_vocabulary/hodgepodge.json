{"short": "A hodgepodge is a random assortment of things. A dorm room might be furnished with a hodgepodge of milk crates, antique mirrors, and a poster of a kitten hanging on a branch with one paw.", "long": "Hodgepodge is a funny-sounding word for a somewhat funny occurrence \u2014 a grouping of things or people that don't fit together. If you made a stew with bacon, oatmeal, and chocolate cake, you\u2019ve made a hodgepodge (and a bellyache waiting to happen). The piles of stuff stacked in attics tend to be a hodgepodge. British people call it a hotchpotch. A hodgepodge can also be called a mishmash."}
