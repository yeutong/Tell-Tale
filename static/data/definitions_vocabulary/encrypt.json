{"short": "To encrypt is to convert regular language into a code. Encrypting is a way of keeping secrets.", "long": "Encrypting is a way of disguising a written message so that most people won't understand it. Encrypting puts a message into a code that will appear to be gibberish. Only someone who knows the code or is an expert in breaking codes \u2014 like a cryptographer \u2014 will be able to read something encrypted. People don't encrypt their laundry lists or term papers; communications that get encrypted are top secret info, like government reports and messages from spies."}
