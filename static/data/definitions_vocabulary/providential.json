{"short": "If your best friend pulls up beside you in her convertible just as your bike gets a flat tire, you could call it providential, or magically lucky.", "long": "The Latin root of providential is providentia, \"foresight or precaution.\" Providence changed over the years; it usually referred specifically to the care of God, and it was spelled with a capital P. Providential, likewise, has another meaning that's purely religious, \"resulting from God's intervention.\" Whether you're talking about God or not, if something is providential, it feels a little miraculous."}
