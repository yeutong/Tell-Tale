{"short": "Imagine yourself pulling a dog who doesn't want to walk. The dog is refractory, or stubbornly resisting your authority.", "long": "The word refractory comes from a Latin word meaning \"obstinate\" and can also be used to mean \"not responsive to something.\" If you have a cold you can't shake, you could say you have a refractory cough. The word can also be used to describe a material that maintains its strength at very high heats. The outside of a space shuttle is made of refractory material, so that it can reenter the atmosphere without burning up."}
