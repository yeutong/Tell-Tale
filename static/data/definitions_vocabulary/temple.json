{"short": "A temple is a religious building that's meant for worshipping or praying. Hindu temples are typically devoted to one specific god.", "long": "While temples tend to be associated with non-Christian religions like Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism, some sects of Orthodox Christianity worship in temples as well. The Mormon church also calls its sacred structures temples. The word comes from the Latin templum, \"consecrated piece of ground\" or \"building for worship of a god,\" from a Proto-Indo-European root, tem-, \"to cut,\" from the idea of a space cleared or \"cut down\" for an altar."}
