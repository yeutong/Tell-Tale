{"short": "Something innovative is new and original. If you love to experiment and find new ways to do things, you are an innovative person.", "long": "Innovative, like nova, novel, and novice, comes from the Latin novus, which means new. Something innovative renews or alters the way something has been done. You can use innovative to describe the thing or the person that made it. If your English teacher objects to your experimental writing style, tell him, \"I'm an innovative writer making innovative sentences!\" Antonyms are unoriginal and hackneyed."}
