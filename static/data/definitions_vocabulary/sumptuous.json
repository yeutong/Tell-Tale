{"short": "Sumptuous could be used to describe a room appointed with the finest furniture, a lush orchestra playing a beautiful symphony, or a meal meant for a king. Sumptuous describes something that costs a lot and imparts sensory pleasure.", "long": "Sumptuous comes from the Latin sumptus, which means \"expensive.\" Sumptus is related to sumere, which means \"to consume.\" The word sumptuous carries both meanings with it. It is a pricey, luxurious thing that's meant to be consumed or enjoyed. You wouldn't use sumptuous to describe a tractor, even if it has leather seats."}
