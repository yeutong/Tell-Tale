{"short": "Salubrious is a fancy way to describe something that\u2019s good for you or is generally favorable to mind or body, but it need not be limited to describing healthy foods or liquids.", "long": "We salute each other with the cheer, \"To your health!\" as we chug down something that probably isn\u2019t that good for us. But if it were salubrious, it would be. The two words, salute and salubrious stem from the same salus, meaning \"welfare, health.\u201d Maybe next time, raise a glass of wheatgrass instead of vino!"}
