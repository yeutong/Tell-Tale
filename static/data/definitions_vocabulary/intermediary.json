{"short": "An intermediary is someone who acts as a go-between or a mediator between two other people. Be careful when you're the intermediary between two friends who are fighting, because they might both end up mad at you!", "long": "The word intermediary comes from the Latin intermedius, which is also the root word for intermediate. Inter- means between, and medius means the middle \u2014 intermediary retains that sense of being in the middle. Intermediaries are used to negotiate between two countries who are at odds, between a company and a client over a contract, between two bickering children, or between a boss and an employee in salary negotiations."}
