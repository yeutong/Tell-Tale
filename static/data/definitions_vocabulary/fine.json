As an adjective, fine means \"high quality\" or \"unblemished\" like fine china.", "long": "If you read music, you know that fine is a spot where the music finishes. Wine, food or porcelain that is exceptionally delicious, well-made, or beautiful is called fine. Fine also means that things are okay or acceptable, like when someone asks how you are and you reply, \u201cI'm fine.\u201d When you are caught doing something wrong, paying a fine, money paid as a penalty, may result."}
