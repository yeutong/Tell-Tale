{"short": "Something that is imminent is just about to happen: if you light a firecracker and then stick it down your pants, a very bad situation is imminent.", "long": "Imminent is from Latin imminere, \"to overhang,\" and to say that something is imminent is to say that it is hanging over you and about to fall, in a metaphorical way. If you take your mom\u2019s car and drive it into the mailbox, getting grounded is imminent. You don\u2019t want that hanging over your head!"}
