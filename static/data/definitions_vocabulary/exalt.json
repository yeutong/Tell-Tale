{"short": "You might like your manager, but if you exalt her, it means you really put her on a pedestal and treat her like royalty.", "long": "To exalt is to hold or raise someone up to a high position or status. It doesn't have to mean literally putting that person into a high position, but instead treating them almost like nobility. Overly doting parents exalt their infant to the point where they praise him every time he wets his diaper and call the neighbors over every time he coos."}
