{"short": "A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something.", "long": "The word paradigm comes up a lot in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in business could mean a new way of reaching customers and making money. In education, relying on lectures is a paradigm: if you suddenly shifted to all group work, that would be a new paradigm. When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something."}
