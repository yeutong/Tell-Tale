{"short": "A reptile is one of those mostly scaly and slimy animals that are cold-blooded and have backbones. Lizards and turtles? Yep \u2014 both reptiles. Puppies and kittens? No way.", "long": "There are many classes of animals. People are part of the mammal class. Another class is reptiles, which are all cold-blooded vertebrates (meaning they have backbones). Snakes, turtles, tortoises, lizards, alligators, chameleons, geckos, skinks, and crocodiles are all reptiles. You'll see plenty of reptiles at the zoo, and you'll see replicas of some at a natural history museum \u2014 since dinosaurs were reptiles!"}
