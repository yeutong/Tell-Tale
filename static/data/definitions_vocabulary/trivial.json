{"short": "Something that is trivial is not important or significant, such as the trivial details you shared with me about your trip to the post office this morning.", "long": "Trivial can also describe something that isn't deep or meaningful, like a trivial movie that you'll forget about after the credits roll. It comes from the Latin word trivium: tri means \"three\" and via is \"road.\" So a trivium is a \"place where three roads meet,\" meaning a crossroads \u2014 just something ordinary. So something that is trivial is not worth remembering; it just isn't important."}
