{"short": "Someone or something that is prolific is fruitful or highly productive. A prolific songwriter can churn out five hit tunes before breakfast.", "long": "A prolific writer cranks out two novels a year, and a prolific rabbit has baby bunnies every few months. The word comes from combining the medieval Latin prolificus (\u201coffspring\u201d) with a form of facere (\u201cto make or do\u201d). It can also connote something taking root and growing, like prolific poison ivy that takes over the yard."}
