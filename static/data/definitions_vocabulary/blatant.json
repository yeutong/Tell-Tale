{"short": "Something blatant is very obvious and offensive. Don't get caught in a blatant lie, because you won't be able to weasel your way out of it.", "long": "Blatant acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is probably from Latin blaterare \"to chatter, croak\" or Latin blat\u012bre \"to chatter, gossip.\" A near synonym is flagrant."}
