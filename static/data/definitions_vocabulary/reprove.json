{"short": "If you get into trouble and are sent to the principal\u2019s office, be prepared for the principal to reprove you for your behavior. To reprove is to scold, reprimand, or \u2014 in plain English \u2014 \u201cchew out.\u201d", "long": "Reprove is a verb used in the same way as \u201cscold,\u201d or \u201cdress down.\u201d To reprove is to express your dissatisfaction or disapproval with something. It\u2019s a less severe word than denounce or decry. It is closer to the verb criticize. Your parents might reprove you for a minor offense like not cleaning your room or chewing with your mouth open. And, for the record, reprove is not the root word prove with the prefix re- as if to mean \u201cprove again.\u201d If you use it that way, someone would likely reprove you."}
