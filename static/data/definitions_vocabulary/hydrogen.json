{"short": "Hydrogen is the very lightest chemical element, and the first one listed on the periodic table. Some scientists believe that hydrogen will one day be used as fuel in cars and trucks.", "long": "Hydrogen's atomic number is one, because it has a single proton in its nucleus. It's a light, flammable gas that's the most common element in the universe. Humans use hydrogen in many ways, including to make ammonia, fertilizers, and petroleum products. It's also used in rocket fuel, and some see its potential as a clean alternative to oil and gas. Hydrogen's Greek roots mean \"water-producing,\" from the fact that when it's exposed to oxygen, hydrogen produces water."}
