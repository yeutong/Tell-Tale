{"short": "When you evade something, you escape it. You could evade a police chase by slipping into a secret alley, or you could evade your mother's questions about the missing cookies by slipping into another topic.", "long": "Other things people like to evade? Death. Taxes. Creepy ex-boyfriends. The verb evade comes from Latin roots ex (\"away) and vadere (\"to walk\"), meaning literally \"to walk away or to escape.\" Definitely what you want to do with creepy ex-boyfriends."}
