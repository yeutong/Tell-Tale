{"short": "Someone impetuous acts too hastily or carelessly. Hotheaded, impulsive folks are impetuous.", "long": "If you're a careful person who thinks everything through and doesn't act rashly, then you're not very impetuous. Impetuous has to do with doing things on the spur of the moment \u2014 and not good things. Being impetuous usually goes along with being impatient and easily angered. If you're impetuous, you act quickly and thoughtlessly when you should just take a deep breath, relax, and think about the best thing to do."}
