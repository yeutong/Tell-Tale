{"short": "Steve baked a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve ate a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve surfeited himself on jam tarts. Whether surfeit is a noun or a verb (as in \"overabundance\" or \"gorge\"), Steve is likely to end up with a bellyache.", "long": "Overabundance, glut, gorge, and cloy: these are all synonyms for surfeit, and they all convey a  sense of too-much-ness, as does the Old French root of the word \u2014 surfaire, \"to overdo.\"  When it is used in reference to food or eating, surfeit tends to suggest indulging to the point of sickness or disgust. In other contexts, though, the meaning is not necessarily negative: \"A surfeit of kindness,\" for example, would hardly be a bad thing."}
