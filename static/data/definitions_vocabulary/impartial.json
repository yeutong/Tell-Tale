{"short": "If you're in a contest, you'd better hope the judges are impartial. That means that they aren't biased toward one competitor over another.", "long": "If you\u2019re partial to the color green, you love green and wear it all the time. If you\u2019re impartial to colors, you don\u2019t care what color you wear. To be impartial is to be objective, so you don\u2019t mind one way or another how something is going to turn out. It\u2019s important for jurors to be impartial when reaching a verdict, rather than allowing biases and preconceptions affect their judgment."}
