{"short": "Something that is buoyant floats in water. Since floating is happier than sinking, buoyant also refers to things are fun and upbeat.", "long": "Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted \u2014 the opposite of sad, depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called bubbly and cheerful, and it should help to remember that buoyant objects float \u2014 just like a buoyant person can seem like they're floating too (as in the expression \"floating on air\")."}
