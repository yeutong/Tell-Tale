{"short": "Anything genetic has to do with your genes and DNA. You inherited your mom's eye color because it's genetic.", "long": "Genetic traits run in families: biological families, anyway. Anything genetic is related to your DNA, the material you inherited from your biological parents. Hair color, eye color, and other physical traits are genetic, and so are some diseases. Scientists do genetic research to see how knowing what\u2019s in your genes could help keep you well. If you're healthy, one reason is good genetics."}
