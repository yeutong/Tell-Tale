{"short": "A tone is the kind of sound you hear in a musical note, or in a person's voice live or in writing. A newspaper article should be objective, but a poem can bring up all kinds of emotions, depending on the tone.", "long": "The word tone often refers to sound, as in music, or the feeling conveyed by the way someone speaks: \"His tone of voice told me I was in trouble.\" It can also be used to describe the atmosphere of a place \u2014 its flavor or spirit \u2014 or the shades of meaning in a work that might reveal the larger intentions of an author. If your body has tone, its muscular structure is strong and appears well defined."}
