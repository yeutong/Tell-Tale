{"short": "Personification means \"giving human qualities to an abstract idea,\" as in a movie villain who is the personification of evil.", "long": "You can use the noun personification in two ways. In the first, a person who is known for a certain quality, like wisdom, is said to represent that quality in a way any can understand, like a patient, generous person who is the personification of kindness. On the other hand, personification can give human qualities to something that isn\u2019t human. For example, you might say, \u201cThe sea is angry,\u201d assigning it a human emotion."}
