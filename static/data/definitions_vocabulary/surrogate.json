{"short": "Someone who acts as a surrogate takes the place of another person. If a celebrity leaves her seat to use the restroom in the middle of a big Hollywood awards ceremony, a surrogate will take her place until she returns.", "long": "Surrogate comes from the Latin word surrogare, which means \"to put in another's place,\" or \"to substitute.\" An uncle might refer to his niece as a surrogate child if they are very close, especially if he doesn't have his own biological children. Since 1978, surrogate has also been used to describe a woman who carries and delivers a baby for another person or couple."}
