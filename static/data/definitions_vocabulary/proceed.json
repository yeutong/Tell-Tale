{"short": "To proceed means to go or continue forward. But somehow \"ready, set, proceed!\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.", "long": "From the Latin procedere, meaning \u201cgo forward, advance,\u201d proceed is a verb that simply means to keep going, particularly after there\u2019s been an interruption. Synonyms include progress and advance. People who constantly interrupt make it really difficult for the conversation to proceed smoothly. And proceed with caution when crossing a busy street, but if the light turns red, you better move it fast!"}
