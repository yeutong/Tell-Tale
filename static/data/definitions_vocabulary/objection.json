{"short": "An objection is a way of saying \"No!\" to something. People offer objections to things they oppose.", "long": "An objection is a statement of protest. During weddings, you often hear the question \"Does anyone object to this union?\" If someone did, that would be an objection: they think the wedding is a bad idea. In court, a lawyer says \"Objection!\" if they think the other lawyer said something unfair or wrong. A little kid who says \"I don't want eggs!\" is making an objection. Any kind of disapproval is an objection. When there are no objections, people agree."}
