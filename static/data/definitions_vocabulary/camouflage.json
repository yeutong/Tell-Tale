{"short": "To camouflage is to disguise, and a camouflage is that which disguises \u0101\u0080\u0094 like the leaf-colored and patterned uniforms worn by soldiers who want to blend in with their natural surroundings.", "long": "Camouflage evolved from the French camoufler, which was slang for \u0101\u0080\u009cto disguise.\u0101\u0080\u009d Camoufler itself most likely comes from camouflet, meaning \u0101\u0080\u009cpuff of smoke\u0101\u0080\u009d \u0101\u0080\u0094 a puff of smoke that makes it hard to see things. Camouflaged clothing certainly hides hunters from their prey, but the word can also be used in a more figurative sense, as in camouflaging criticism by veiling it as a backhanded compliment."}
