{"short": "To misconstrue is to get the wrong idea about something. If you misconstrue a friend\u2019s silence, you might get mad at him for ignoring you \u2014 until you find out he has a sore throat and can\u2019t talk.", "long": "The verb misconstrue comes from mis- meaning \"wrong\" and construe meaning \"construction.\" Combined they mean \"to put a wrong construction on\" \u2014 in other words, to interpret in the wrong way. Sometimes people can intentionally allow others to misconstrue something for personal gain. For example, a politician may let voters misconstrue her voting record if she believes doing so will help her get elected."}
