{"short": "If you want to be insubordinate, go ahead and break the rules, ignore orders, and act like a disobedient rebel.", "long": "Words that have similar meanings to insubordinate include \"rebellious\" and \"mutinous.\" But while insubordinate people don't follow orders, rebellious folks openly defy them and mutinous groups try to overthrow the authority that created them. When baseball player Jackie Robinson objected to racial discrimination in the Army in the 1940s, he was accused of being insubordinate. He was court martialed, but found innocent and acquitted."}
