{"short": "When you cut something in half or in two pieces, you bisect it. You can bisect a cupcake so that you and a friend get equal pieces.", "long": "In Latin, bi means \"two\" and secare means \"to cut.\" That's why the verb bisect means \"divide into two equal pieces.\" You might bisect your garden, planting half with vegetables and half with flowers, or tape a line on your bedroom floor to bisect the space into two sides \u2014 yours and your horrible sister's. In geometry, the word bisect means the same thing, to split something into equal halves."}
