{"short": "Quotidian is a fancy way of saying \"daily\" or \"ordinary.\" Quotidian events are the everyday details of life.", "long": "When you talk about the quotidian, you're talking about the little things in life: everyday events that are normal and not that exciting. Going to the store, doing chores, working or going to school, and brushing your teeth are all quotidian. If you take a spaceship to Mars, that would be unusual and extraordinary: the opposite of quotidian."}
