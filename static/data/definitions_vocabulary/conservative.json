{"short": "If you are conservative, you aren\u2019t necessarily a card-carrying member of the Republican party (though you might be); it means you resist change.", "long": "Conservative has the word conserve in it, which means \"to hold on to, or save.\" In a drought, you want to be conservative in your water use. If you don\u2019t get paid that much and don\u2019t want to use credit cards, you\u2019d better be conservative with your money. And if you dress in a conservative way, you prefer traditional styles to new trends and fads."}
