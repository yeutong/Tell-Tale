{"short": "If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or secret, sneak in furtive. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your furtive attempts to pass notes in class!", "long": "The adjective, furtive, is related to f\u016brtum, the Latin word for theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions \"to give someone a furtive glance\" and \"to steal a glance at someone\" mean the same thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning, but they lack this image of a thief's actions."}
