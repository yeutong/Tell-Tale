{"short": "The physics principle whereby objects are forced to move out from the center is called centrifugal force. This apparent force is activated by something moving in a curved direction; the heavier the object the stronger the force.", "long": "The word centrifugal is from the Latin centrum, \"center,\" and fugere, \"to flee,\" so the word means \"center-fleeing.\" Centrifugal force was studied by physicists as far back as 1629, and the term itself was used by Sir Isaac Newton, in its Latin guise vis centrifuga, in 1687."}
