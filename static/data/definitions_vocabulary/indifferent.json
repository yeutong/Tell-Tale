You might feel indifferent about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on.", "long": "People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned \u2014 an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin.
