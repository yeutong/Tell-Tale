{"short": "Apathetic is an adjective that describes the feeling of being bored with what\u2019s going on around you.  If you don\u2019t care one way or another, you\u2019re apathetic.", "long": "The Greek word pathos describes a type of emotional suffering that afflicts people who are super sensitive to their environment.  Pathos is a root word of apathetic, but the prefix a- turns it into the opposite: emotional boredom, insensitivity, and a lack of enthusiasm.  Maybe you feel apathetic because nothing around you stirs your interest, or maybe it\u2019s because you need some coffee."}
