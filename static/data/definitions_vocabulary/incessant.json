{"short": "Something incessant continues without interruption. When you're on a cross-country flight, it's tough to tolerate the incessant crying of a baby.", "long": "In Latin, cessare means \"to stop,\" so when you add the negative prefix in-, you get a word meaning \"never stopping.\"  A near synonym is continual, but something incessant is more relentless; ceaseless is a closer synonym. It's rare to find incessant used in a positive way. Even incessant sunshine would grow boring."}
