{"short": "If your cousin tells revolting jokes, belches, and smells like he spent the winter in a cave, he could be described as boorish \u0101\u0080\u0094 an adjective used for people with bad manners and a sloppy appearance.", "long": "We almost always use the word boorish for men. This may be because it can be traced back to a 13th century word for \u0101\u0080\u009cherdsman.\u0101\u0080\u009d Herdsmen spent a lot of time alone with their sheep, sleeping in tents, and cooking over open fires, so it was no wonder that they didn't have the same refined manners as city folk. If someone offends you by acting boorishly \u0101\u0080\u0094 say, by cutting you off in traffic \u0101\u0080\u0094 you could exclaim, \u0101\u0080\u009cWhat a boor!\u0101\u0080\u009d  Just don't confuse boor with bore: bad manners may be offensive, but they're rarely boring."}
