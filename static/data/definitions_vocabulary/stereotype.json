{"short": "A stereotype is a preconceived notion, especially about a group of people. Many stereotypes are rooted in prejudice \u2014 so you should be wary of them.", "long": "You have probably heard stereotypes: commonly held ideas or preconceptions about specific groups. You most often hear about negative stereotypes, but some are positive \u2014 the stereotype that tall people are good at basketball, for example. One of many problems with any stereotype is that even if it's true in some cases, it's certainly not true in all cases."}
