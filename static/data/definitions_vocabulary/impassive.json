{"short": "Someone who doesn't seem to react \u014c\u0106\u00f6 who is always \"taking a pass\" in the conversation of life can be described as impassive.", "long": "Impassive is tricky, as it sounds it should be the opposite of passive. It's not, though. The fact is you can be passive and impassive at the same time. When a passive person gets passed over for a promotion at work, their face might remain impassive upon hearing the news."}
