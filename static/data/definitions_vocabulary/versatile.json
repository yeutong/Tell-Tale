{"short": "To describe a person or thing that can adapt to do many things or serve many functions, consider the adjective versatile.", "long": "In E.B. White's classic children's book Charlotte's Web, Charlotte the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. \"What does 'versatile' mean \u2014 full of eggs?\" Wilbur asks. \"Certainly not,\" Charlotte replies. \"'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one thing to another.\" Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word reflects its Latin root, versatilis, \"turning around; revolving.\" It eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the entertainment world."}
