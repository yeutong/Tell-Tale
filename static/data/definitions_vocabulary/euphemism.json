{"short": "Pardon me, but when a polite term is substituted for a blunt, offensive one, you should call it a euphemism.", "long": "Euphemism is from Greek euphemismos, meaning \"good speech,\" and it's a way that we paper over uncomfortable things with more pleasant-sounding words. These days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: toilet, bathroom, and water closet were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying \"neutralizing the target\" instead of \"killing someone.\""}
