{"short": "Flaunt is \"to display proudly or show off,\" like when you flaunt your new Italian leather jacket by wearing it to the beach and pretending you're cold to make sure everyone sees it.", "long": "Although we love it when a peacock flaunts his colorful feathers, when a person does the same thing we feel bad. Flaunt is like bragging, which can bum people out because they don't have whatever you're showing off, like that cool jacket. When rich people flaunt their wealth by speeding past you in their limo, they may as well splash a mud puddle on your white clothes. Leave the flaunting for peacocks and stars in bad reality TV shows."}
