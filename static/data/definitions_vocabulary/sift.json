When you sift, you separate out one thing from another.", "long": "When you sort through the mail looking for the bills or go through your photos to find that shot of your dog, that\u2019s sifting, too.

When you're at the beach, you can sift sand through your fingers, and you might see big machines that sift the sand to clean it."}
