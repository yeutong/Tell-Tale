{"short": "Have you noticed that many pet owners resemble their pets? Or is it that pets resemble their owners? Either way, it\u2019s downright strange how they often look alike.", "long": "Derived from the old French word sembler, \u201cto appear,\u201d the verb resemble can imply a whole spectrum of likeness. For example, you might closely resemble your schnauzer or, hopefully, only vaguely resemble each other. It\u2019s not just about appearance, either. This concept can include all kinds of characteristics. Two companies can resemble each other and the same could be said of two philosophies."}
