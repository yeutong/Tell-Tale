{"short": "If something is supposed to happen but hasn\u0101\u0080\u0099t happened yet, it is pending, like the pending snowstorm that has everyone scrambling to the store for bread and milk.", "long": "The word pending comes from the French pendant, meaning \u0101\u0080\u009changing.\u0101\u0080\u009d If someone leaves you hanging, you are waiting for a call, a message, a visit \u0101\u0080\u0094 whatever the thing is that's supposed to happen. Pending is a good word to use when something has to happen before something else \u0101\u0080\u0094 like if you are learning to drive, maybe you'll have a car of your own soon, pending your success at passing the test."}
