{"short": "An incumbent is an official who holds an office. If you want to run for congress, you're going to have to beat the incumbent.", "long": "Incumbent comes from the Latin word incumbens, which means \"lying in\" or \"leaning on,\" but came to mean \"holding a position.\" It was first used in English for someone holding a church office, and then someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for political officials. In a race for mayor, the incumbent mayor faces a challenger. Incumbent also means \"required by obligation.\" It is incumbent upon you to do the dishes."}
