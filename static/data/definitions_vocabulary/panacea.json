{"short": "If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don\u2019t take the pill.  It\u2019s a panacea, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.", "long": "The Greek word pan means \u201call\u201d (think of a panorama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The Greek word for \u201ccure\u201d is ak\u0113s (which looks like the word \u201caches\u201d).  Those are the roots of panacea, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn\u2019t really cure everything; it just acts like it can.  Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you."}
