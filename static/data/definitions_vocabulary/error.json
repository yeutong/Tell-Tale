{"short": "\"I'm sorry, sir, there's been some sort of error in the kitchen,\" is what a restaurant waiter might say to a patron who ordered the fish but was mistakenly served a plateful of worms instead.", "long": "Simply put, an error is a mistake. However, that mistake is more likely due to a lapse in judgment or skill than to an accident. A plane crash that occurs after the pilot mistakenly presses the \"pilot eject\" button is said to be caused by \"human error.\" A baseball play in which the pitcher throws the ball to second base instead of first because he was distracted by a pretty girl in the stands is an error \u2014 one that might cost his team the game."}
