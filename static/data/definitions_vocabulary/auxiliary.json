{"short": "When you're offering something in support of an already existing thing, you're offering something auxiliary. The auxiliary police will help out the regular police with things like directing traffic and crowd control when there's a special event in town.", "long": "The Latin word auxilium means \"help,\" and so auxiliary means something that \"helps\" by providing backup or support. Think of auxiliary verbs (sometimes called helper verbs), that provide support within a verb phrase, as \"is\" does in \"Helen is playing.\" You can have an auxiliary engine in a car, an auxiliary cook at a restaurant, an auxiliary electrical network at a factory, or auxiliary troops standing by during battle. A \"Ladies Auxiliary\" functions as support for institutions such as churches, synagogues, or charities."}
