{"short": "\u201cDarn you!\u201d \u201cGo bury your head in the sand.\u201d \u201cYou ugly nincompoop!\u201d Each of those nasty curses is a malediction (and, I\u2019m sure, nothing you would ever say to another human being).", "long": "A malediction is a curse. Not like the kind a witch puts on someone, but close. More like what the schoolyard bully says to hurt someone\u2019s feelings. On purpose. Malediction has male in it, but it\u2019s not a slur against men or boys. Mal comes from the Latin for \"evil\" and \"diction,\" and as you may remember, has to do with what we say. So a malediction is an evil statement directed at someone else. Pretty nasty, if you ask me."}
