{"short": "Use salutary to describe something that's good for your health, like the salutary benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.", "long": "When you look at the word salutary, you might expect it to have something to do with showing respect to military personnel, perhaps by saluting. In fact, salutary and salute do share a Latin root: salus, which means \"good health.\" When you salute someone, or say \"Salud!\" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish \u2014 in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health."}
