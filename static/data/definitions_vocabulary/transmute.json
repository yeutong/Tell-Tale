{"short": "Transmute is a verb meaning to change in appearance or form. For example, magical creatures can transmute into other beings. When you're fighting a wizard, don\u2019t be surprised if he transmutes into a terrifying dragon.", "long": "More realistically, you, too, can transmute your appearance \u2014 by dying your hair, piercing your nose, or changing your style of dress. Transmute often describes physical change \u2014 like when alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold \u2014 but it can also be used more figuratively to describe anything that's transformed. For example, you might transmute your sketchy memories of growing up in Boston into the Great American Novel."}
