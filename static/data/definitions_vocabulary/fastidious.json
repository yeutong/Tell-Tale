{"short": "If you want to describe a person who insists on perfection or pays much attention to food, clothing and cleanliness, the right word is fastidious.", "long": "Fastidious is a funny-sounding adjective from the Latin fastidium \"loathing\" that has several equally strange-sounding synonyms \u2014 persnickety, fussbudgety, finicky and punctilious. Fussy and hard to please will also do the trick. Fastidious is occasionally used as a compliment to describe someone whose attention to detail gives them good organizing abilities, but it is usually used as a disapproving term."}
