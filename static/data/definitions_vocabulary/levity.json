{"short": "Joking that your dead grandmother \"never looked better\" could inject some levity, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.", "long": "Levity literally means \"lightness,\" and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood. Yet levity is often used to describe humor that's not appropriate to the occasion, like telling jokes during a funeral."}
