{"short": "If a newspaper editorial describes a politician as feckless, you might wonder, \"What is feck, and why doesn\u2019t he have any?\u201d In fact, the columnist is accusing the politician of being irresponsible and incompetent.", "long": "Did you know that most varieties of English are in fact \u201cfeck\u201d-less? They don\u2019t contain a word feck, only the negative counterpart feckless. The \u201cfeck\u201d in feckless began as a short form of effect used in the Scots dialect. So feckless essentially means \"ineffective,\" but is also used to describe someone who is irresponsible, incompetent, inept, or without purpose in life."}
