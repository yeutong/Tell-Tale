{"short": "You can describe someone who lacks courage as pusillanimous, such as a pusillanimous student who is too afraid to speak out against someone who is bullying others.", "long": "Its Latin origin \u2014 pusillus and animus \u2014 tells us that pusillanimous means \"very small spirit.\" If you are pusillanimous, pronounced \"pew-sill-AN-ih-mus,\" you don't have the spirit \u2014 or the confidence or drive \u2014 to step up when it matters. The pusillanimous person stays quiet, doesn't get involved, waits for someone else to take a stand \u2014 not out of laziness, but out of fear."}
