Once your long-winded history teacher gets started on an anecdote about the Civil War, everyone in the class sighs deeply.", "long": "A long-winded explanation is one that uses many words when just a few would do. And your grandfather's long-winded toasts before Thanksgiving dinner inevitably end in everyone's food getting cold before they can start eating it. An older meaning of this word was \"able to do something for a long time without losing one's breath,\" but the modern definition dates from the 1580s, when it specifically meant \"given to lengthy speeches.\""}
