{"short": "Having finesse means you can handle difficult situations with diplomacy and tact, like the finesse it takes to help two friends work out their differences \u2014 without taking sides or alienating either one.", "long": "Finesse is having grace under pressure. It's handling the rantings of an angry customer with a smile and a calm tone. Someone who has finesse says the right thing at the right time \u2014 or knows when to say nothing at all. Finesse looks like fineness and in fact comes from the Middle French word that means exactly that \u2014 delicate in nature. People with finesse can handle anything \u2014 with a delicate approach that really works."}
