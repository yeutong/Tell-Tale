{"short": "Use the adjective jejune to describe something that is uninteresting or insignificant. Many people claim to find celebrity gossip jejune, but ask them about a recent movie star scandal and chances are they know all about it.", "long": "Jejune can also describe something that\u2019s immature or simplistic. All that actress could say about her latest movie was that it was \u201cSuper fun\u201d? That\u2019s a pretty jejune comment. Basically jejune means lacking substance. It originally comes from the Latin word jejunus, which means \u201cfasting,\u201d so when something is jejune, it\u2019s figuratively empty \u2014 devoid of intellectual nourishment."}
