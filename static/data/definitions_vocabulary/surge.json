{"short": "A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs the land. Although a surge offers a fluid image, anything can experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support, or an angry mob.", "long": "The original Latin word surgere, meaning \u201cto spring up or rise,\u201d serves as the basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden growth or swelling.  If you are watching a sad movie and you experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?  Yeah, me too.  Christmas shopping can be dangerous when there is a surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge into stores trying to grab it up."}
