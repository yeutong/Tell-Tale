{"short": "A predilection is a preference for or bias toward something. If you have a predilection for wool clothing, you should take up knitting.", "long": "Predilection is based on the Latin verb praediligere, or \"prefer before others,\" which breaks down to prae, before, and diligere, \"choose or love.\" We often use the word predilection for tendencies that people seem to have been born with, also called predispositions. If you're a night owl, you probably have a predilection for cities, while morning people tend to prefer the country."}
