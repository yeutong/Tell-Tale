{"short": "If you walked away from a nasty bike accident without a scratch, you walked away unscathed, meaning you came out unharmed.", "long": "You can also come through a scandal unscathed, with your reputation untarnished, or your dog-walking business may emerge from the financial crisis unscathed and more profitable than ever. With the word unscathed, there's always a sense of something bad that might have happened but didn't."}
