{"short": "Something that is outmoded is no longer cool or in style, like your dad's outmoded hairstyle that he's had since he was in high school.", "long": "The French are known for their sense of fashion and style, so it's no surprise that they coined the word d\u00e9mod\u00e9 to describe things that are no longer cool. De- means \"out, off, away\" and mode means \"fashion.\" The English word outmoded is simply a translation of d\u00e9mod\u00e9: \"out of fashion\" or \"out of style.\""}
