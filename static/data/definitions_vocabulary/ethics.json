{"short": "When discussing a code of morals, choose the noun ethics. You might call a politician who uses taxpayer money for wild parties a little \"ethics-challenged.\"", "long": "Ethics can mean the study of morality \u2014 what's right and wrong. When discussing this branch of philosophy, treat the word as singular, despite the \"-s\": \"Ethics is no longer widely taught.\" But in the sense of \"moral correctness\" or \"a moral code,\" treat it as plural: \"The ethics of capital punishment are complex.\" Don't confuse it with ethos, which means \"the characteristic spirit of a culture.\" (Both words come from Greek ethos, \"moral character.\")"}
