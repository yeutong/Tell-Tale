{"short": "There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.", "long": "Pedantic means \"like a pedant,\" someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of 18th-century porcelain kitty-litter boxes."}
