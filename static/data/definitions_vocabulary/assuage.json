{"short": "If you assuage an unpleasant feeling, you make it go away. Assuaging your hunger by eating a bag of marshmallows may cause you other unpleasant feelings.", "long": "The most common things that we assuage are fears, concerns, guilt, grief, anxiety, and anger. That makes a lot of sense \u2014 these are all things we seek relief from. The word comes from Old French assouagier, from the Latin root suavis, \"sweet\" \u2014 think of adding a bit of honey to something unpleasant. A word with a similar meaning is mollify."}
