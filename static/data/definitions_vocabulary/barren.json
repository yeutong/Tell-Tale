{"short": "Drive through a forest that's just been destroyed by a fire, and you'll get an idea of what barren means \u2014 stripped of vegetation and devoid of life.", "long": "Not to be confused with a baron, a kind of nobleman, barren is often used to describe an area of land that lacks any signs of life. A barren wilderness is dry and empty, with no foliage or twittering birds to be found. An old-fashioned and unflattering word for a woman who is unable to have children is barren."}
