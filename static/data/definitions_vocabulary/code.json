{"short": "A code can be a set of principles. Our laws make up our legal code, and many people govern themselves through a personal \"code of honor.\" Code can also mean a system for sending secret messages, or programming language for computers.", "long": "In 1303, you could only use code to mean a set of laws, such as a code of conduct. It wasn\u2019t until 1808 that you could use code to describe a system for sending secret messages. The verb form appeared in 1815, meaning to create laws or send secret messages, and gave birth to encode. In the computer programming context, encode was shortened back again to code, meaning to write instructions for a computer program. Soon the lines of text themselves began to be referred to as simply code."}
