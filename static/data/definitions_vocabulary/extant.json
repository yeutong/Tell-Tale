{"short": "Use the adjective extant to describe old things that are still around, like your extant diary from third grade or the only extant piece of pottery from certain craftspeople who lived hundreds of years ago.", "long": "Extant is the opposite of extinct: it refers to things that are here \u2014 they haven't disappeared or been destroyed. Use extant to describe things that it may be surprising to learn are still around \u2014 you wouldn't say jeans you bought last year are extant, but a pair of jeans worn by Marilyn Monroe back in the 1950s? Definitely extant."}
