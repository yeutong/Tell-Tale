{"short": "You might be enraged at the idea of doing homework on a Saturday if you consider your weekends sacrosanct \u014c\u0106\u00f6 meaning they are too special or important to interrupt.", "long": "Sacrosanct is often used to describe religious rituals and traditions, which isn\u014c\u0106\u00d6t surprising considering that this adjective comes from the Latin word for something that is protected by a religious sanction. A church, for example, might consider its Sunday service to be sacrosanct \u014c\u0106\u00f6 a very important and holy ritual that cannot be changed or canceled. It\u014c\u0106\u00d6s a bad idea to criticize or change any custom or tradition that people consider sacrosanct \u014c\u0106\u00f6 they won\u014c\u0106\u00d6t be happy about it."}
