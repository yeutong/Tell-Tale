{"short": "When a parent scolds a teenager for missing a curfew or blowing off a test and the teen snaps back, \"Whatever,\" you could say the teen is being flippant. His reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.", "long": "When it first showed up in the English language around the 17th century, flippant meant glib and talkative. But over the years it has developed a more negative connotation. Today flippant is used to describe a blas\u00e9 attitude or comment in a situation that calls for seriousness. Make a flippant comment about your friend's mother and the odds are good that they'll be offended."}
