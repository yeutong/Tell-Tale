{"short": "Lackluster is a compound adjective that means what it sounds like: if something is lackluster it lacks luster; in other words, it is without brilliance, shine, or vitality. Think dull.", "long": "Shakespeare gave us the compound lackluster, first using the term in his play As You Like It. In 2:7, the character Jacques says, \"And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye...\" Since Shakespeare first coined this word, it has been used to describe anything \"blah\"; lackluster sales would worry shop owners and a lackluster prom dress might help you blend in with the wallpaper."}
