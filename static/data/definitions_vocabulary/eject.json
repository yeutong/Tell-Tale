{"short": "It\u2019s good to eject yourself from a burning spaceship (if you happen to have an escape pod and a nice small planet to land on), but if a teacher ejects you from class, well that\u2019s not so good.", "long": "Eject comes from \u201cjectere,\u201d the Latin word meaning throw, but the \u201ce\u201d means out. If you want to say, \u201cthrow the rascals out!\u201d in only one word, you should choose, \u201ceject!\u201d The opposite of eject is inject. Thinking about the nurse throwing the measles vaccine into your arm makes that doctor\u2019s visit seem a little less friendly."}
