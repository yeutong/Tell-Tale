{"short": "No reason to get excited \u0101\u0080\u0094 cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance.", "long": "Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning \"rapid,\" which comes from the Latin word cursorius, meaning \"hasty, of a race or running.\" Something that is cursory is done quickly. A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions."}
