{"short": "Have a family tree hanging on the wall? Then you know a bit about your ancestry, or family history and lineage.", "long": "If you think ancestry sounds like ancestor, then you're headed in the right direction. Ancestry is basically a history of ancestors, a trail of where your family started and all the descendants that followed. But ancestry goes much further than just your great-great-grand uncle's brother. You can also use the word ancestry to refer to the background of things other than people \u2014 such as the ancestry of a building or the ancestry of a nation."}
