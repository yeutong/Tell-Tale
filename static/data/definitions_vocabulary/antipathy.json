{"short": "An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change \u014c\u0106\u00f6 like your antipathy for the Red Sox.", "long": "If you look at the Greek roots of this word \u014c\u0106\u00f6 anti- (\"against\") and pathos (\"feeling\") \u014c\u0106\u00f6 you can see that antipathy is a feeling against someone or something. In general, antipathies are feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out in the open."}
