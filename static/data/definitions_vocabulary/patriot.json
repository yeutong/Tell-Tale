{"short": "A patriot is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. \u201cNathan Hale was a true patriot; his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.\u201d", "long": "The word patriot comes from patrios (Greek, not Latin for once), which means \"of one\u2019s father.\" So, despite various references to the motherland, the word patriot more or less lands us square in the fatherland arena. And if you\u2019re a football fan, the New England Patriots is a near-Boston-based team (Boston being a major source of American patriots in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want to get yourself in trouble, you can wander Boston with a megaphone chanting, \u201cThe Patriots stink.\u201d"}
