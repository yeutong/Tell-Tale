{"short": "If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or unbiased, party (who will probably tell you not to buy either one).", "long": "Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and English teachers being way too uptight. While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean \u201cunbiased,\u201d the debate rages on as to whether it can also mean \u201cuninterested\u201d or \u201cindifferent.\u201d Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this secondary meaning. (Of course, you\u2019ll also find the disinterested \u2014 or uninterested? \u2014 folks who couldn\u2019t care less.)"}
